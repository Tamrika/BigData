It’s only because Hillary Clinton is losing that she is lobbing conspiracy theory. Citizen Quasar The way I see it, one of two things will happen: 1. Trump will win by a landslide but the election will be stolen via electronic voting, just like I have been predicting for over a decade, and the American People will accept the skewed election results just like they accept the TSA into their crotches. 2. Somebody will bust a cap in Hillary’s @$$ killing her and the election will be postponed. Follow AMTV!\"\"\",\n",

Gold and silver in actual purchasing power will also rise. They won’t be saying an ounce of gold bought a good suit 100 years ago and an ounce of gold will buy a good suit now. That’s going to change, and it’s also going to change radically with silver .

Soon after McConnell's remarks, 42 Democrats again filibustered the resolution, preventing it from getting the 60 votes needed to advance.\"My strong preference is for Democrats to simply allow an up-or-down vote on the president's Iran deal.\" McConnell said. \"But if they're determined to make that impossible, then at the very least we should be able to provide some protection to Israel and long-overdue relief to Americans who've languished in Iranian custody for years.

              "      <td>Daniel Greenfield, a Shillman Journalism Fellow at the Freedom Center, is a New York writer focusing on radical Islam. \\nIn the final stretch of the election, Hillary Rodham Clinton has gone to war with the FBI. \\nThe word “unprecedented” has been thrown around so often this election that it ought to be retired. But it’s still unprecedented for the nominee of a major political party to go war with the FBI. \\nBut that’s exactly what Hillary and her people have done. Coma patients just waking up now and watching an hour of CNN from their hospital beds would assume that FBI Director James Comey is Hillary’s opponent in this election. \\nThe FBI is under attack by everyone from Obama to CNN. Hillary’s people have circulated a letter attacking Comey. There are currently more media hit pieces lambasting him than targeting Trump. It wouldn’t be too surprising if the Clintons or their allies were to start running attack ads against the FBI. \\nThe FBI’s leadership is being warned that the entire left-wing establishment will form a lynch mob if they continue going after Hillary. And the FBI’s credibility is being attacked by the media and the Democrats to preemptively head off the results of the investigation of the Clinton Foundation and Hillary Clinton. \\nThe covert struggle between FBI agents and Obama’s DOJ people has gone explosively public. \\nThe New York Times has compared Comey to J. Edgar Hoover. Its bizarre headline, “James Comey Role Recalls Hoover’s FBI, Fairly or Not” practically admits up front that it’s spouting nonsense. The Boston Globe has published a column calling for Comey’s resignation. Not to be outdone, Time has an editorial claiming that the scandal is really an attack on all women. \\nJames Carville appeared on MSNBC to remind everyone that he was still alive and insane. He accused Comey of coordinating with House Republicans and the KGB. And you thought the “vast right wing conspiracy” was a stretch. \\nCountless media stories charge Comey with violating procedure. Do you know what’s a procedural violation? Emailing classified information stored on your bathroom server. \\nSenator Harry Reid has sent Comey a letter accusing him of violating the Hatch Act. The Hatch Act is a nice idea that has as much relevance in the age of Obama as the Tenth Amendment. But the cable news spectrum quickly filled with media hacks glancing at the Wikipedia article on the Hatch Act under the table while accusing the FBI director of one of the most awkward conspiracies against Hillary ever. \\nIf James Comey is really out to hurt Hillary, he picked one hell of a strange way to do it. \\nNot too long ago Democrats were breathing a sigh of relief when he gave Hillary Clinton a pass in a prominent public statement. If he really were out to elect Trump by keeping the email scandal going, why did he trash the investigation? Was he on the payroll of House Republicans and the KGB back then and playing it coy or was it a sudden development where Vladimir Putin and Paul Ryan talked him into taking a look at Anthony Weiner’s computer? \\nEither Comey is the most cunning FBI director that ever lived or he’s just awkwardly trying to navigate a political mess that has trapped him between a DOJ leadership whose political futures are tied to Hillary’s victory and his own bureau whose apolitical agents just want to be allowed to do their jobs. \\nThe only truly mysterious thing is why Hillary and her associates decided to go to war with a respected Federal agency. Most Americans like the FBI while Hillary Clinton enjoys a 60% unfavorable rating. \\nAnd it’s an interesting question. \\nHillary’s old strategy was to lie and deny that the FBI even had a criminal investigation underway. Instead her associates insisted that it was a security review. The FBI corrected her and she shrugged it off. But the old breezy denial approach has given way to a savage assault on the FBI. \\nPretending that nothing was wrong was a bad strategy, but it was a better one that picking a fight with the FBI while lunatic Clinton associates try to claim that the FBI is really the KGB. \\nThere are two possible explanations. \\nHillary Clinton might be arrogant enough to lash out at the FBI now that she believes that victory is near. The same kind of hubris that led her to plan her victory fireworks display could lead her to declare a war on the FBI for irritating her during the final miles of her campaign. \\nBut the other explanation is that her people panicked. \\nGoing to war with the FBI is not the behavior of a smart and focused presidential campaign. It’s an act of desperation. When a presidential candidate decides that her only option is to try and destroy the credibility of the FBI, that’s not hubris, it’s fear of what the FBI might be about to reveal about her. \\nDuring the original FBI investigation, Hillary Clinton was confident that she could ride it out. And she had good reason for believing that. But that Hillary Clinton is gone. In her place is a paranoid wreck. Within a short space of time the “positive” Clinton campaign promising to unite the country has been replaced by a desperate and flailing operation that has focused all its energy on fighting the FBI. \\nThere’s only one reason for such bizarre behavior. \\nThe Clinton campaign has decided that an FBI investigation of the latest batch of emails poses a threat to its survival. And so it’s gone all in on fighting the FBI. It’s an unprecedented step born of fear. It’s hard to know whether that fear is justified. But the existence of that fear already tells us a whole lot. \\nClinton loyalists rigged the old investigation. They knew the outcome ahead of time as well as they knew the debate questions. Now suddenly they are no longer in control. And they are afraid. \\nYou can smell the fear. \\nThe FBI has wiretaps from the investigation of the Clinton Foundation. It’s finding new emails all the time. And Clintonworld panicked. The spinmeisters of Clintonworld have claimed that the email scandal is just so much smoke without fire. All that’s here is the appearance of impropriety without any of the substance. But this isn’t how you react to smoke. It’s how you respond to a fire. \\nThe misguided assault on the FBI tells us that Hillary Clinton and her allies are afraid of a revelation bigger than the fundamental illegality of her email setup. The email setup was a preemptive cover up. The Clinton campaign has panicked badly out of the belief, right or wrong, that whatever crime the illegal setup was meant to cover up is at risk of being exposed. \\nThe Clintons have weathered countless scandals over the years. Whatever they are protecting this time around is bigger than the usual corruption, bribery, sexual assaults and abuses of power that have followed them around throughout the years. This is bigger and more damaging than any of the allegations that have already come out. And they don’t want FBI investigators anywhere near it. \\nThe campaign against Comey is pure intimidation. It’s also a warning. Any senior FBI people who value their careers are being warned to stay away. The Democrats are closing ranks around their nominee against the FBI. It’s an ugly and unprecedented scene. It may also be their last stand. \\nHillary Clinton has awkwardly wound her way through numerous scandals in just this election cycle. But she’s never shown fear or desperation before. Now that has changed. Whatever she is afraid of, it lies buried in her emails with Huma Abedin. And it can bring her down like nothing else has.</td>\n",

              "      <td>Google Pinterest Digg Linkedin Reddit Stumbleupon Print Delicious Pocket Tumblr \\nThere are two fundamental truths in this world: Paul Ryan desperately wants to be president. And Paul Ryan will never be president. Today proved it. \\nIn a particularly staggering example of political cowardice, Paul Ryan re-re-re-reversed course and announced that he was back on the Trump Train after all. This was an aboutface from where he was a few weeks ago. He had previously declared he would not be supporting or defending Trump after a tape was made public in which Trump bragged about assaulting women. Suddenly, Ryan was appearing at a pro-Trump rally and boldly declaring that he already sent in his vote to make him President of the United States. It was a surreal moment. The figurehead of the Republican Party dosed himself in gasoline, got up on a stage on a chilly afternoon in Wisconsin, and lit a match. . @SpeakerRyan says he voted for @realDonaldTrump : “Republicans, it is time to come home” https://t.co/VyTT49YvoE pic.twitter.com/wCvSCg4a5I \\n— ABC News Politics (@ABCPolitics) November 5, 2016 \\nThe Democratic Party couldn’t have asked for a better moment of film. Ryan’s chances of ever becoming president went down to zero in an instant. In the wreckage Trump is to leave behind in his wake, those who cravenly backed his campaign will not recover. If Ryan’s career manages to limp all the way to 2020, then the DNC will have this tape locked and loaded to be used in every ad until Election Day. \\nThe ringing endorsement of the man he clearly hates on a personal level speaks volumes about his own spinelessness. Ryan has postured himself as a “principled” conservative, and one uncomfortable with Trump’s unapologetic bigotry and sexism. However, when push came to shove, Paul Ryan – like many of his colleagues – turned into a sniveling appeaser. After all his lofty tak about conviction, his principles were a house of cards and collapsed with the slightest breeze. \\nWhat’s especially bizarre is how close Ryan came to making it through unscathed. For months the Speaker of the House refused to comment on Trump at all. His strategy seemed to be to keep his head down, pretend Trump didn’t exist, and hope that nobody remembered what happened in 2016. Now, just days away from the election, he screwed it all up. \\nIf 2016’s very ugly election has done any good it’s by exposing the utter cowardice of the Republicans who once feigned moral courage. A reality television star spit on them, hijacked their party, insulted their wives, and got every last one of them to kneel before him. What a turn of events. \\nFeatured image via Twitter</td>\n",

              "      <td>U.S. Secretary of State John F. Kerry said Monday that he will stop in Paris later this week, amid criticism that no top American officials attended Sunday’s unity march against terrorism.\\n\\nKerry said he expects to arrive in Paris Thursday evening, as he heads home after a week abroad. He said he will fly to France at the conclusion of a series of meetings scheduled for Thursday in Sofia, Bulgaria. He plans to meet the next day with Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius and President Francois Hollande, then return to Washington.\\n\\nThe visit by Kerry, who has family and childhood ties to the country and speaks fluent French, could address some of the criticism that the United States snubbed France in its darkest hour in many years.\\n\\nThe French press on Monday was filled with questions about why neither President Obama nor Kerry attended Sunday’s march, as about 40 leaders of other nations did. Obama was said to have stayed away because his own security needs can be taxing on a country, and Kerry had prior commitments.\\n\\nAmong roughly 40 leaders who did attend was Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, no stranger to intense security, who marched beside Hollande through the city streets. The highest ranking U.S. officials attending the march were Jane Hartley, the ambassador to France, and Victoria Nuland, the assistant secretary of state for European affairs. Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. was in Paris for meetings with law enforcement officials but did not participate in the march.\\n\\nKerry spent Sunday at a business summit hosted by India’s prime minister, Narendra Modi. The United States is eager for India to relax stringent laws that function as barriers to foreign investment and hopes Modi’s government will act to open the huge Indian market for more American businesses.\\n\\nIn a news conference, Kerry brushed aside criticism that the United States had not sent a more senior official to Paris as “quibbling a little bit.” He noted that many staffers of the American Embassy in Paris attended the march, including the ambassador. He said he had wanted to be present at the march himself but could not because of his prior commitments in India.\\n\\n“But that is why I am going there on the way home, to make it crystal clear how passionately we feel about the events that have taken place there,” he said.\\n\\n“And I don’t think the people of France have any doubts about America’s understanding of what happened, of our personal sense of loss and our deep commitment to the people of France in this moment of trauma.”</td>\n",

              "      <td>\\nI’m not an immigrant, but my grandparents are. More than 50 years ago, they arrived in New York City from Iran. I grew up mainly in central New Jersey, an American kid playing little league for the Raritan Red Sox and soccer for the Raritan Rovers. In 1985, I travelled with my family to our ancestral land. I was only eight, but old enough to understand that the Iranians had lost their liberty and freedom. I saw the abject despair of a people who, in a desperate attempt to bring about change, had ushered in nationalist tyrants led by Ayatollah Khomeini. \\nWhat I witnessed during that year in Iran changed the course of my life. In 1996, at age 19, wanting to help preserve the blessings of liberty and freedom we enjoy in America, I enlisted in the U.S. Navy. Now, with the rise of Donald Trump and his nationalist alt-right movement, I’ve come to feel that the values I sought to protect are in jeopardy. \\nIn Iran, theocratic fundmentalists sowed division and hatred of outsiders — of Westerners, Christians, and other religious minorities. Here in America, the right wing seems to have stolen passages directly from their playbook as it spreads hatred of immigrants, particularly Muslim ones. This form of nationalistic bigotry — Islamophobia — threatens the heart of our nation. When I chose to serve in the military, I did so to protect what I viewed as our sacred foundational values of liberty, equality, and democracy. Now, 20 years later, I’ve joined forces with fellow veterans to again fight for those sacred values, this time right here at home. \\n“Death to America!” \\nAs a child, I sat in my class at the international school one sunny morning and heard in the distance the faint sounds of gunfire and rising chants of “Death to America!” That day would define the rest of my life. \\nIt was Tehran, the capital of Iran, in 1985. I was attending a unique school for bilingual students who had been born in Western nations. It had become the last refuge in that city with any tolerance for Western teaching, but that also made it a target for military fundamentalists. As the gunfire drew closer, I heard boots pounding the marble tiles outside, marching into our building, and thundering down the corridor toward my classroom. As I heard voices chanting “Death to America!” I remember wondering if I would survive to see my parents again. \\nIn a flash of green and black uniforms, those soldiers rushed into our classroom, grabbed us by our shirt collars, and yelled at us to get outside. We were then packed into the school’s courtyard where a soldier pointed his rifle at our group and commanded us to look up. Almost in unison, my classmates and I raised our eyes and saw the flags of our many nations being torn down and dangled from the balcony, then set ablaze and tossed, still burning, into the courtyard. As those flags floated to the ground in flames, the soldiers fired their guns in the air. Shouting, they ordered us — if we ever wanted to see our families again — to swear allegiance to the Grand Ayatollah Khomeini and trample on the remains of the burning symbols of our home countries. I scanned the smoke that was filling the courtyard for my friends and classmates and, horrified, watched them capitulate and begin to chant, “Death to America!” as they stomped on our sacred symbols. \\nI was so angry that, young as I was, I began to plead with them to come to their senses. No one paid the slightest attention to an eight year old and yet, for the first time in my life, I felt something like righteous indignation. I suspect that, born and raised in America, I was already imbued with such a sense of privilege that I just couldn’t fathom the immense danger I was in. Certainly, I was acting in ways no native Iranian would have found reasonable. \\nAcross the smoke-filled courtyard, I saw a soldier coming at me and knew he meant to force me to submit. I spotted an American flag still burning, dropped to my knees, and grabbed the charred pieces from underneath a classmate’s feet. As the soldier closed in on me, I ducked and ran, still clutching my charred pieces of flag into a crowd of civilians who had gathered to witness the commotion. The events of that day would come to define all that I have ever stood for — or against. \\n“Camel Jockey,” “Ayatollah,” and “Gandhi” \\nMy parents and I soon returned to the United States and I entered third grade. More than anything, I just wanted to be normal, to fit in and be accepted by my peers. Unfortunately, my first name, Nader (which I changed to Nate upon joining the Navy), and my swarthy Middle Eastern appearance, were little help on that score, eliciting regular jibes from my classmates. Even at that young age, they had already mastered a veritable thesaurus of ethnic defamation, including “camel jockey,” “sand-nigger,” “raghead,” “ayatollah,” and ironically, “Gandhi” (which I now take as a compliment). My classmates regularly sought to “other-ize” me in those years, as if I were a lesser American because of my faith and ethnicity. \\nYet I remember that tingling in my chest when I first donned my Cub Scout uniform — all because of the American flag patch on its shoulder. Something felt so good about wearing it, a feeling I still had when I joined the military. It seems that the flag I tried to rescue in Tehran was stapled to my heart, or that’s how I felt anyway as I wore my country’s uniform. \\nWhen I took my oath of enlistment in the U.S. Navy, I gave my mom a camera and asked her to take some photos, but she was so overwhelmed with pride and joy that she cried throughout the ceremony and managed to snap only a few images of the carpet. She cried even harder when I was selected to serve as the first Muslim-American member of the U.S. Navy Presidential Ceremonial Honor Guard . On that day, I was proud, too, and all the taunts of those bullies of my childhood seemed finally silenced. \\nBeing tormented because of my ethnicity and religion in those early years had another effect on me. It caused me to become unusually sensitive to the nature of other people. Somehow, I grasped that, if it weren’t for a fear of the unknown, there was an inherent goodness and frail humanity lurking in many of the kids who bullied and harassed me. Often, I discovered, those same bullies could be tremendously kind to their families, friends, or even strangers. I realized, then, that if, despite everything, I could lay myself bare and trust them enough to reach out in kindness, I might in turn gain their trust and they might then see me, too, and stop operating from such a place of fear and hate. \\nThrough patience, humor, and understanding, I was able to offer myself as the embodiment of my people and somehow defang the “otherness” of so much that Americans found scary. To this day, I have friends from elementary school, middle school, high school, and the military who tell me that I am the only Muslim they have ever known and that, had they not met me, their perspective on Islam would have been wholly subject to the prevailing fear-based narrative that has poisoned this country since September 11, 2001. \\nIn 1998, I became special assistant to the Master Chief Petty Officer of the Navy and then, in 1999, I was recruited to serve at the Defense Intelligence Agency. In August 2000, I transferred to the Naval Reserve. \\nIn the wake of 9/11, I began to observe how so many of my fellow Americans were adopting a fundamentalist “us vs. them” attitude towards Muslims and Islam. I suddenly found myself in an America where the scattered insults I had endured as a child took on an overarching and sinister meaning and form, where they became something like an ideology and way of life. \\nBy the time I completed my military service in 2006, I had begun to understand that our policies in the Middle East,similarly disturbed, seemed in pursuit of little more than perpetual warfare. That, in turn, was made possible by the creation of a new enemy: Islam — or rather of a portrait, painted by the powers-that-be, of Islam as a terror religion, as a hooded villain lurking out there somewhere in the desert, waiting to destroy us. I knew that attempting to dispel, through the patient approach of my childhood, the kind of Islamophobia that now had the country by the throat was not going to be enough. Post-9/11 attacks on Muslims in the U.S. and elsewhere were not merely childish taunts. \\nFor the first time in my life, in a country gripped by fear, I believed I was witnessing a shift, en masse, toward an American fundamentalism and ultra-nationalism that reflected a wanton lack of reason, not to mention fact. As a boy in Iran, I had witnessed the dark destination down which such a path could take a country. Now, it seemed to me, in America’s quest to escape the very demons we had sown by our own misadventures in the Middle East, and forsaking the hallmarks of our founding, we risked becoming everything we sought to defeat. \\nThe Boy in the Schoolyard Grown Up \\nOn February 10, 2015, three young American students, Yusor Abu-Salha, Razan Abu-Salha, and Deah Shaddy Barakat, were executed at an apartment complex in Chapel Hill, North Carolina. The killer was a gun-crazy white man filled with hate and described by his own daughter as “a monster.” Those assassinations struck a special chord of sorrow and loss in me. My mom and I cried and prayed together for those students and their families. \\nThe incident in Chapel Hill also awoke in me some version of the righteous indignation I had felt so many years earlier in that smoke-filled courtyard in Iran. I would be damned if I stood by while kids in my country were murdered simply because of their faith. It violated every word of the oath I had taken when I joined the military and desecrated every value I held in my heart as a sacred tenet of our nation. White nationalists and bigots had, by then, thrown down the gauntlet for so much of this, using Islamophobia to trigger targeted assassinations in the United States. This was terrorism, pure and simple, inspired by hate-speakers here at home. \\nAt that moment, I reached out to fellow veterans who, I thought, might be willing to help — and it’s true what they say about soul mates being irrevocably drawn to each other. When I contacted Veterans For Peace , an organization dedicated to exposing the costs of war and militarism, I found the leadership well aware of the inherent dangers of Islamophobia and of the need to confront this new enemy. So Executive Director Michael McPhearson formed a committee of vets from around the country to decide how those of us who had donned uniforms to defend this land could best battle the phenomenon — and I, of course, joined it. \\nFrom that committee emerged Veterans Challenge Islamophobia (VCI). It now has organizers in Arizona, Georgia, New Jersey, and Texas, and that’s just a beginning. Totally nonpartisan, VCI focuses on politicians of any party who engage in hate speech. We’ve met with leaders of American Muslim communities, sat with them through Ramadan, and attended their Iftar dinners to break our fasts together. In the wake of the Orlando shooting , we at VCI also mobilized to fight back against attempts to pit the Muslim community against the LGBTQ+ community. \\nOur group was born of the belief that, as American military veterans, we had a responsibility to call out bigotry, hatred, and the perpetuation of endless warfare. We want the American Muslim community to know that they have allies, and that those allies are indeed veterans as well. We stand with them and for them and, for those of us who are Muslim, among them. \\nNationalism and xenophobia have no place in American life, and I, for my part, don’t think Donald Trump or anyone like him should be able to peddle Islamophobia in an attempt to undermine our national unity. Without Islamophobia, there no longer exists a “clash of civilizations.” Without Islamophobia, whatever the problems in the world may be, there is no longer an “us vs. them” and it’s possible to begin reimagining a world of something other than perpetual war. \\nAs of now, this remains the struggle of my life, for despite my intense love for America, some of my countrymen increasingly see American Muslims as the “other,” the enemy. \\nMy Mom taught me as a boy that the only thing that mattered was what was in my heart. Now, with her in mind and as a representative of VCI, when I meet fellow Americans I always remember my childhood experiences with my bullying peers. And I still lay myself bare, as I did then. I give trust to gain trust, but always knowing that these days this isn’t just a matter of niceties. It’s a question of life or death. It’s part of a battle for the soul of our nation. \\nIn many ways, I still consider myself that boy in the school courtyard in Tehran trying to rescue charred pieces of that flag from those trampling feet. It’s just that now I’m doing it in my own country. \\nNate Terani is a veteran of the U.S. Navy and served in military intelligence with the Defense Intelligence Agency.

              "      <td>Share This Baylee Luciani (left), Screenshot of what Baylee caught on FaceTime (right) \\nThe closest Baylee Luciani could get to her boyfriend, who’s attending college in Austin, was through video online chat. The couple had regular “dates” this way to bridge the 200-mile distance between them. However, the endearing arrangement quickly came to an end after his FaceTime was left on and caught something that left his girlfriend horrified. \\nBaylee had been discussing regular things with her boyfriend, Yale Gerstein, who was on the other side of the screen on an otherwise average evening. This video chat was not unlike all the others she had with Yale from his apartment near Austin Community College until the 19-year-old girlfriend heard some scratching sounds after FaceTime had been left on. \\nAccording to KRON , Baylee was mid-conversation with Yale when scratches at the door caught both of their attention and he got up from his bed, where the computer was, to see who was at his door. He barely turned the handle to open in when masked men entered the room and beat Yale’s face in and slammed him down on his bed while shoving a pistol in his cheek. The intruders didn’t seem to know or care that FaceTime was still on and Baylee’s face, seen in the corner, was watching everything, terrified that she was about to see her boyfriend murdered in front of her, as she watched him fight for his life. \\nAdmitting that she first thought it was a joke, seconds later, she came to the horrid realization that he was being robbed and called her dad, who was at home with her in Dallas, into the room. “I was scared, because they were saying I’m going to blow your head off, I’m going to kill you,” Baylee explained along with the chilling feeling she got when the intruder finally realized the video chat was running and looked right at her in the camera. “I’m like wow… seriously watching an armed robbery happen to somebody that I care about,” she added. Screengrabs of intruder forcing Yale down on his bed while Baylee and her father watch on FaceTime in horror \\nWith a clear view of at least one intruder’s face, Baylee began taking screenshots of the suspect in the act as she and her dad called the police to report what was going on. She got the pictures right in time since, seconds later, the intruder decided to disconnect the computer as he and the suspects took off with thousands of dollars worth of Yale’s music equipment. Although the boyfriend’s life was spared in the traumatizing ordeal for the two of them, he said that the thieves took something from him that can’t be replaced. \\n“I had just finished my first album as a solo artist,” Yale said. “That’s all lost,” since they took the recordings on the equipment, which means nothing to the thieves and everything to the victim. It’s not often that you hear of FaceTime solving crimes or potentially saving lives, which is what happened in this case. Although it was difficult to watch, Baylee, being there through technology, was an instrumental part in protecting Yale, who hopefully learned that he better take advantage of Texas’ great gun laws and arm himself with more than just a computer.</td>\n",

              "      <td>Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump made some inaccurate claims during an NBC “commander-in-chief” forum on military and veterans issues:\\n\\n• Clinton wrongly claimed Trump supported the war in Iraq after it started, while Trump was wrong, once again, in saying he was against the war before it started.\\n\\n• Trump said that President Obama set a “certain date” for withdrawing troops from Iraq, when that date was set before Obama was sworn in.\\n\\n• Trump said that Obama’s visits to China, Saudi Arabia and Cuba were “the first time in the history, the storied history of Air Force One” when “high officials” of a host country did not appear to greet the president. Not true.\\n\\n• Clinton said that Trump supports privatizing the Veterans Health Administration. That’s false. Trump said he supports allowing veterans to seek care at either public or private hospitals.\\n\\n• Trump said Clinton made “a terrible mistake on Libya” when she was secretary of State. But, at the time, Trump also supported U.S. action that led to the removal of Moammar Gadhafi from power.\\n\\n• Trump cherry-picked Clinton’s words when he claimed Clinton said “vets are being treated, essentially, just fine.” Clinton had said the problems in the Department of Veterans Affairs were not as “widespread” as some Republicans claimed, but she went on to acknowledge problems, including the issue of wait times for doctors.\\n\\nThe forum, sponsored by NBC News and the Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America, was held Sept. 7 at the Intrepid Sea, Air &amp; Space Museum in New York City. Today show host Matt Lauer, and members of the military and veterans in the audience, questioned the candidates separately.\\n\\nTrump said he “was totally against the war in Iraq,” while Clinton claimed that he supported the Iraq War before and after it started. The facts don’t support either candidate’s strong assertions.\\n\\nOur review of Trump’s statements before and after the Iraq War started found no evidence that Trump opposed the war before it started. In fact, he expressed mild support for invading Iraq when asked about it on the Howard Stern radio show on Sept. 11, 2002 — about six months before the war started.\\n\\nStern asked Trump if he supported a war with Iraq, and Trump responded, “Yeah, I guess so.”\\n\\nIn the NBC commander in chief forum, Trump cited an Esquire article that appeared in August 2004 to show his opposition to the war. But that article appeared 17 months after the war started.\\n\\nAs for Clinton, who as a senator voted in October 2002 to authorize the war in Iraq, the Democratic nominee claimed that Trump “supported it before it happened, he supported it as it was happening and he is on record as supporting it after it happened.”\\n\\nBut just as there is no evidence that Trump opposed the Iraq War before it started, the Clinton campaign offered no evidence that Trump supported the war “after it happened.”\\n\\nThe Clinton campaign cited Trump’s interview on March 21, 2003, with Neil Cavuto of Fox Business just two days after the war started.\\n\\nCavuto asked Trump about the impact of the war on the stock market. Trump said the war “looks like a tremendous success from a military standpoint,” and he predicted the market will “go up like a rocket” after the war. But Cavuto does not ask Trump whether the U.S. should have gone to war with Iraq or whether he supports the war, and Trump doesn’t offer an opinion.\\n\\nAs early as July 2003, Trump expressed concern on Hardball with Chris Matthews about money being spent in Iraq rather than in the U.S. Two months later, Trump told MSNBC’s Joe Scarborough, “I guess maybe if I had to do it, I would have fought terrorism but not necessarily Iraq.”\\n\\nClinton invited her audience to read Trump’s comments on the Iraq War. They can read our timeline, “Donald Trump and the Iraq War.”\\n\\nTrump said President Obama set a “certain date” for withdrawing troops from Iraq, but that date was actually set by President George W. Bush.\\n\\nNBC’s Matt Lauer asked Trump about his tendency to respond, when pushed for details on his military proposals, that he’s not going to give details because he wants to be “unpredictable.” Trump responded, “Absolutely,” and went on to criticize Obama for revealing the withdrawal date.\\n\\nAs we said then, Republicans and Democrats disagree on whether Obama or Bush is to blame for withdrawing all combat troops from Iraq at the end of 2011. But that date was set when Bush signed the Status of Forces Agreement on Dec. 14, 2008. It said: “All the United States Forces shall withdraw from all Iraqi territory no later than December 31, 2011.”\\n\\nIn the NBC forum, Trump also called the withdrawal of troops “a terrible decision.” As we’ve explained before, Condoleezza Rice, Bush’s secretary of State, later wrote that Bush wanted an agreement for a residual force to remain, but Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki objected.\\n\\nOnce Obama took office in January 2009, he had three years to renegotiate the deal, which his administration tried to do, to leave a residual American troop force. But Maliki still didn’t agree. Negotiations broke down in October 2011 over the issue of whether U.S. troops would be shielded from criminal prosecution by Iraqi authorities. Whether Obama did enough is a matter of opinion: His then defense secretary, Leon Panetta, later wrote that the president didn’t press hard enough for a deal. But some experts say Iraq was more closely aligned at the time with Iran and there wasn’t a deal to be made with Maliki.\\n\\nSo, both presidents had a role in the withdrawal of troops. But Trump wrongly said that Obama was the one who set a “certain date” for withdrawal and let U.S. enemies know about it, when that date was set before Obama was sworn in.\\n\\nIt’s worth noting that Trump said in a March 16, 2007, interview on CNN that the troops should be withdrawn quickly from Iraq.\\n\\nTrump said that Obama’s visits to China, Saudi Arabia and Cuba were “the first time in the history, the storied history of Air Force One” when “high officials” of a host country did not appear to greet the president.\\n\\nThat’s not true. Other presidents have encountered similar low-key greetings on foreign trips aboard the presidential aircraft.\\n\\nTrump referred to the fact that Cuba’s president, Raul Castro, did not greet Obama at the airport on his historic visit to Cuba in March, that Saudi Arabia’s King Salman did not meet Air Force One at the start of Obama’s trip to Riyadh in April, and he referred to China’s handling of the president’s arrival in Hangzhou last Saturday for a Group of 20 meeting.\\n\\nWhether or not those arrivals constituted snubs of a U.S. president as Trump claims is a matter of debate. But Trump is wrong on the facts when he claims it has not happened before. It has.\\n\\nIn 1984, for example, Ronald Reagan landed in Beijing and was received by China’s foreign minister rather than the president, whom he met only later. Similarly, on a 1985 trip to West Germany, Reagan was met by the foreign minister and not Chancellor Helmut Kohl.\\n\\nThese and other examples were dug up by our friend Glenn Kessler, the Washington Post‘s “Fact Checker,” who researched a Trump claim in April that Cuba’s and Saudi Arabia’s handling of Obama’s visits were “without precedent.” Kessler said of Trump, “once again he’s wrong, wrong, wrong.”\\n\\nKessler also noted that during Richard Nixon’s historic 1972 visit to China he was greeted at the airport by the country’s number two man, Premier Zhou Enlai. His boss, Chairman Mao, didn’t even agree to meet with Nixon until after he had arrived at a guest house.\\n\\nClinton said that her plan to overhaul the Veterans Health Administration would not include privatization, which she said Trump supports.\\n\\nBut Trump refuted that statement when it was his turn to discuss his plan to help veterans. “I would not do that,” Trump said, referring to Clinton’s claim that he supports privatization.\\n\\nTrump’s campaign published “The Goals Of Donald J. Trump’s Veterans Plan” on its website last October. It doesn’t call for the VA to be completely privatized.\\n\\nOne of the biggest changes that plan would make to the current VA health care system is allowing veterans to get care at any non-VA medical center that accepts Medicare.\\n\\n“Under a Trump Administration, all veterans eligible for VA health care can bring their veteran’s ID card to any doctor or care facility that accepts Medicare to get the care they need immediately,” the plan states.\\n\\n“The power to choose will stop the wait time backlogs and force the VA to improve and compete if the department wants to keep receiving veterans’ healthcare dollars,” the plan says.\\n\\nTrump’s proposal would seemingly go further than the Non-VA Medical Care Program, which allows eligible veterans to access care outside of the VA under certain circumstances, such as when VA medical centers cannot provide services. The program requires pre-approval for veterans to receive care at a non-VA facility in non-emergency situations.\\n\\nTrump’s proposal would also go further than the bipartisan Veterans Choice Act of 2014 that President Obama signed into law, creating a temporary program, separate from the Non-VA Medical Care Program, that allows eligible veterans to receive health care at a non-VA facility if they would have to wait more than 30 days for an appointment at a VA medical center, or if they live more than 40 miles from the nearest VA hospital.\\n\\nTrump stuck to the idea of allowing veterans to choose between public and private hospitals when he released his most recent “Ten Point Plan To Reform The VA” in July.\\n\\nPoint 10 of the plan says: “Mr. Trump will ensure every veteran has the choice to seek care at the VA or at a private service provider of their own choice. Under a Trump Administration, no veteran will die waiting for service.”\\n\\nTrump reinforced that part of his plan during the NBC News forum as well.\\n\\nTo be clear, Trump supports giving veterans a choice between VA hospitals and private ones. That’s not the same thing as supporting the complete privatization of the system that provides care to veterans.\\n\\nTrump criticized Clinton for making “a terrible mistake on Libya” when she was secretary of State. But, at the time, Trump also supported U.S. action that led to the removal of Moammar Gadhafi from power.\\n\\nTrump made his claim in response to a question posed by Lauer on whether Trump will be “prepared on Day One,” if elected president, to tackle “complex national security issues.”\\n\\nThis isn’t the first time Trump has ignored his past support for the U.S. intervention in Libya.\\n\\nDuring the 10th GOP debate, Trump said he had “never discussed that subject” when Sen. Ted Cruz called him out on supporting U.S. action in the country. But, as we wrote, Trump said in 2011 that the U.S. should go into Libya “on a humanitarian basis” and “knock [Gadhafi] out very quickly, very surgically, very effectively and save the lives.”\\n\\nTrump made that comment in a video posted to his YouTube channel in February 2011:\\n\\nEven though Trump now says Clinton’s support for intervention in Libya was a “terrible mistake,” it doesn’t change the fact that five years ago he supported Gadhafi’s removal.\\n\\nTrump twisted Clinton’s words when he claimed Clinton said “vets are being treated, essentially, just fine.” Clinton said the problems in the Department of Veterans Affairs were not as “widespread” as some Republican supporters of privatization of the VA claim, but she went on to acknowledge problems in the VA system — including the issue of wait times for doctors — and what she would do to address them.\\n\\nTrump highlighted the issue of wait times to see a doctor as “one of the big problems” in the VA, and then suggested Clinton doesn’t think the VA has problems.\\n\\nLauer interrupted, noting that Clinton “went on after that and laid out a litany of problems within the VA.”\\n\\nTrump insisted his version was accurate, adding, “I’m telling you … she said she was satisfied with what was going on in the Veterans Administration.”\\n\\nThat’s not accurate. The comments in question from Clinton came during an interview with MSNBC’s Rachel Maddow on Oct. 23, 2015. Maddow asked about talk among some Republicans of abolishing the VA and privatizing it. “The reason they are able to propose something that radical is because the problems at the VA seem so intractable,” Maddow said.\\n\\nMaddow asked if Clinton had any “new ideas for trying to fix” the VA. Here was Clinton’s response, with the part Trump is referring to in bold.\\n\\nClinton accused Republicans of underfunding the VA because they “want it to fail” so they can privatize it.\\n\\nClinton added, “But we have to be more creative about trying to fix the problems that are the legitimate concern, so that we can try to stymie the Republican assault.”\\n\\nIndeed, the Clinton campaign website states that Clinton wants to “fundamentally reform veterans’ health care to ensure access to timely and high quality care.” The campaign says Clinton “was outraged by the recent scandals at the VA, and as president, she will demand accountability and performance from VA leadership.” The site specifically mentions Clinton’s dissatisfaction that “[m]any veterans have to wait an unacceptably long time to see a doctor or to process disability claims and appeals” and promises she will “[b]uild a 21st-century Department of Veterans Affairs to deliver world-class care.”\\n\\nTrump cherry-picked the part of Clinton’s response that said problems in the VA have “not been as widespread as it has been made out to be,” to make the blanket claim that Clinton is “satisfied with what was going on in the Veterans Administration” and that “vets are being treated, essentially, just fine.” But Trump is leaving out the parts of Clinton’s answer that acknowledged problems in the VA — including the wait time issue Trump highlighted as one of his biggest concerns.</td>\n",

              "      <td>Iranian negotiators reportedly have made a last-ditch push for more concessions from the U.S. and five other world powers as talks on the fate of Iran's nuclear program come down to the final days before a crucial deadline.\\n\\nThe New York Times reported late Sunday that Tehran had backed away from a tentative promise to ship a large portion of its uranium stockpile to Russia, where it could not be used as part of any future weapons program. Western officials insisted to the paper that the uranium did not have to be sent overseas, but could be disposed of in other ways.\\n\\nThe new twist in the talks comes just two days before the deadline for both sides to agree on a framework for a permanent deal. The final deadline for a permanent deal would not arrive until the end of June.\\n\\nHowever, if Iran insists on keeping its uranium in the country, it would undermine a key argument made in favor of the deal by the Obama administration. The Times reports that if the uranium had gone to Russia, it would have been converted into fuel rods, which are difficult to use in nuclear weapons. It is not clear what would happen to the uranium if it remained in Iran.\\n\\nThe Associated Press reported Sunday that Iran's position had shifted from from demanding that it be allowed to keep nearly 10,000 centrifuges enriching uranium, to agreeing to keep 6,000. Western officials involved in the talks told the Associated Press that Tehran may be ready to accept an even lower number.\\n\\nThe United States and its allies want a deal that extends the time Iran would need to make a nuclear weapon from the present two months to three months to at least a year. However, The Times reported Sunday that a paper published by Olli Heinonen, former head of inspections for the U.N.'s nuclear watchdog, estimated that Iran could still develop a nuclear weapon in seven or eight months with around 6,500 centrifuges.\\n\\nTehran says it wants to enrich uranium only for energy, science, industry and medicine. But many countries fear Iran could use the technology to make weapons-grade uranium.\\n\\nOfficials told the Associated Press that another main dispute involved the length of an agreement. Iran, they said, wants a total lifting of all caps on its activities after 10 years, while the U.S. and the five other nations at the talks — Russia, China, Britain, France and Germany — insist on progressive removal after a decade.\\n\\nA senior U.S. official characterized the issue as lack of agreement on what happens in years 11 to 15. The official spoke on condition of anonymity in line with State Department rules on briefing about the closed-door talks.\\n\\nLimits on Iran's research and development of centrifuges also were unresolved, the Western officials said.\\n\\nTehran has created a prototype centrifuge that it says enriches uranium 16 times faster than its present mainstay model. The U.S. and its partners want to constrain research that would increase greatly the speed of making enough weapons-grade uranium for a bomb, once limits on Iran's programs are lifted.\\n\\nOne official said Russia opposed the U.S. position that any U.N. penalties lifted in the course of a deal should be reimposed quickly if Tehran reneged on any commitments.\\n\\nBoth Western officials said Iran was resisting attempts to make inspections and other ways of verification as intrusive as possible.\\n\\nThere was tentative agreement on turning a nearly-finished reactor into a model that gives off less plutonium waste than originally envisaged. Plutonium, like enriched uranium, is a path to nuclear weapons.\\n\\nIran and the U.S. were discussing letting Iran run centrifuges at an underground bunker that has been used to enrich uranium. The machines would produce isotopes for peaceful applications, the officials said.\\n\\nWith the Tuesday deadline approaching and problems remaining, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry canceled plans Sunday to return to the United States for an event honoring the late U.S. Sen. Edward Kennedy. French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius and Frank-Walter Steinmeier, his German counterpart, scratched planned trips to Kazakhstan.\\n\\nKerry has been in discussions with Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif since Thursday.\\n\\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.\\n\\nClick for more from The New York Times.</td>\n",

              "0  Daniel Greenfield, a Shillman Journalism Fellow at the Freedom Center, is a New York writer focusing on radical Islam. \\nIn the final stretch of the election, Hillary Rodham Clinton has gone to war with the FBI. \\nThe word “unprecedented” has been thrown around so often this election that it ought to be retired. But it’s still unprecedented for the nominee of a major political party to go war with the FBI. \\nBut that’s exactly what Hillary and her people have done. Coma patients just waking up now and watching an hour of CNN from their hospital beds would assume that FBI Director James Comey is Hillary’s opponent in this election. \\nThe FBI is under attack by everyone from Obama to CNN. Hillary’s people have circulated a letter attacking Comey. There are currently more media hit pieces lambasting him than targeting Trump. It wouldn’t be too surprising if the Clintons or their allies were to start running attack ads against the FBI. \\nThe FBI’s leadership is being warned that the entire left-wing establishment will form a lynch mob if they continue going after Hillary. And the FBI’s credibility is being attacked by the media and the Democrats to preemptively head off the results of the investigation of the Clinton Foundation and Hillary Clinton. \\nThe covert struggle between FBI agents and Obama’s DOJ people has gone explosively public. \\nThe New York Times has compared Comey to J. Edgar Hoover. Its bizarre headline, “James Comey Role Recalls Hoover’s FBI, Fairly or Not” practically admits up front that it’s spouting nonsense. The Boston Globe has published a column calling for Comey’s resignation. Not to be outdone, Time has an editorial claiming that the scandal is really an attack on all women. \\nJames Carville appeared on MSNBC to remind everyone that he was still alive and insane. He accused Comey of coordinating with House Republicans and the KGB. And you thought the “vast right wing conspiracy” was a stretch. \\nCountless media stories charge Comey with violating procedure. Do you know what’s a procedural violation? Emailing classified information stored on your bathroom server. \\nSenator Harry Reid has sent Comey a letter accusing him of violating the Hatch Act. The Hatch Act is a nice idea that has as much relevance in the age of Obama as the Tenth Amendment. But the cable news spectrum quickly filled with media hacks glancing at the Wikipedia article on the Hatch Act under the table while accusing the FBI director of one of the most awkward conspiracies against Hillary ever. \\nIf James Comey is really out to hurt Hillary, he picked one hell of a strange way to do it. \\nNot too long ago Democrats were breathing a sigh of relief when he gave Hillary Clinton a pass in a prominent public statement. If he really were out to elect Trump by keeping the email scandal going, why did he trash the investigation? Was he on the payroll of House Republicans and the KGB back then and playing it coy or was it a sudden development where Vladimir Putin and Paul Ryan talked him into taking a look at Anthony Weiner’s computer? \\nEither Comey is the most cunning FBI director that ever lived or he’s just awkwardly trying to navigate a political mess that has trapped him between a DOJ leadership whose political futures are tied to Hillary’s victory and his own bureau whose apolitical agents just want to be allowed to do their jobs. \\nThe only truly mysterious thing is why Hillary and her associates decided to go to war with a respected Federal agency. Most Americans like the FBI while Hillary Clinton enjoys a 60% unfavorable rating. \\nAnd it’s an interesting question. \\nHillary’s old strategy was to lie and deny that the FBI even had a criminal investigation underway. Instead her associates insisted that it was a security review. The FBI corrected her and she shrugged it off. But the old breezy denial approach has given way to a savage assault on the FBI. \\nPretending that nothing was wrong was a bad strategy, but it was a better one that picking a fight with the FBI while lunatic Clinton associates try to claim that the FBI is really the KGB. \\nThere are two possible explanations. \\nHillary Clinton might be arrogant enough to lash out at the FBI now that she believes that victory is near. The same kind of hubris that led her to plan her victory fireworks display could lead her to declare a war on the FBI for irritating her during the final miles of her campaign. \\nBut the other explanation is that her people panicked. \\nGoing to war with the FBI is not the behavior of a smart and focused presidential campaign. It’s an act of desperation. When a presidential candidate decides that her only option is to try and destroy the credibility of the FBI, that’s not hubris, it’s fear of what the FBI might be about to reveal about her. \\nDuring the original FBI investigation, Hillary Clinton was confident that she could ride it out. And she had good reason for believing that. But that Hillary Clinton is gone. In her place is a paranoid wreck. Within a short space of time the “positive” Clinton campaign promising to unite the country has been replaced by a desperate and flailing operation that has focused all its energy on fighting the FBI. \\nThere’s only one reason for such bizarre behavior. \\nThe Clinton campaign has decided that an FBI investigation of the latest batch of emails poses a threat to its survival. And so it’s gone all in on fighting the FBI. It’s an unprecedented step born of fear. It’s hard to know whether that fear is justified. But the existence of that fear already tells us a whole lot. \\nClinton loyalists rigged the old investigation. They knew the outcome ahead of time as well as they knew the debate questions. Now suddenly they are no longer in control. And they are afraid. \\nYou can smell the fear. \\nThe FBI has wiretaps from the investigation of the Clinton Foundation. It’s finding new emails all the time. And Clintonworld panicked. The spinmeisters of Clintonworld have claimed that the email scandal is just so much smoke without fire. All that’s here is the appearance of impropriety without any of the substance. But this isn’t how you react to smoke. It’s how you respond to a fire. \\nThe misguided assault on the FBI tells us that Hillary Clinton and her allies are afraid of a revelation bigger than the fundamental illegality of her email setup. The email setup was a preemptive cover up. The Clinton campaign has panicked badly out of the belief, right or wrong, that whatever crime the illegal setup was meant to cover up is at risk of being exposed. \\nThe Clintons have weathered countless scandals over the years. Whatever they are protecting this time around is bigger than the usual corruption, bribery, sexual assaults and abuses of power that have followed them around throughout the years. This is bigger and more damaging than any of the allegations that have already come out. And they don’t want FBI investigators anywhere near it. \\nThe campaign against Comey is pure intimidation. It’s also a warning. Any senior FBI people who value their careers are being warned to stay away. The Democrats are closing ranks around their nominee against the FBI. It’s an ugly and unprecedented scene. It may also be their last stand. \\nHillary Clinton has awkwardly wound her way through numerous scandals in just this election cycle. But she’s never shown fear or desperation before. Now that has changed. Whatever she is afraid of, it lies buried in her emails with Huma Abedin. And it can bring her down like nothing else has.

              "1  Google Pinterest Digg Linkedin Reddit Stumbleupon Print Delicious Pocket Tumblr \\nThere are two fundamental truths in this world: Paul Ryan desperately wants to be president. And Paul Ryan will never be president. Today proved it. \\nIn a particularly staggering example of political cowardice, Paul Ryan re-re-re-reversed course and announced that he was back on the Trump Train after all. This was an aboutface from where he was a few weeks ago. He had previously declared he would not be supporting or defending Trump after a tape was made public in which Trump bragged about assaulting women. Suddenly, Ryan was appearing at a pro-Trump rally and boldly declaring that he already sent in his vote to make him President of the United States. It was a surreal moment. The figurehead of the Republican Party dosed himself in gasoline, got up on a stage on a chilly afternoon in Wisconsin, and lit a match. . @SpeakerRyan says he voted for @realDonaldTrump : “Republicans, it is time to come home” https://t.co/VyTT49YvoE pic.twitter.com/wCvSCg4a5I \\n— ABC News Politics (@ABCPolitics) November 5, 2016 \\nThe Democratic Party couldn’t have asked for a better moment of film. Ryan’s chances of ever becoming president went down to zero in an instant. In the wreckage Trump is to leave behind in his wake, those who cravenly backed his campaign will not recover. If Ryan’s career manages to limp all the way to 2020, then the DNC will have this tape locked and loaded to be used in every ad until Election Day. \\nThe ringing endorsement of the man he clearly hates on a personal level speaks volumes about his own spinelessness. Ryan has postured himself as a “principled” conservative, and one uncomfortable with Trump’s unapologetic bigotry and sexism. However, when push came to shove, Paul Ryan – like many of his colleagues – turned into a sniveling appeaser. After all his lofty tak about conviction, his principles were a house of cards and collapsed with the slightest breeze. \\nWhat’s especially bizarre is how close Ryan came to making it through unscathed. For months the Speaker of the House refused to comment on Trump at all. His strategy seemed to be to keep his head down, pretend Trump didn’t exist, and hope that nobody remembered what happened in 2016. Now, just days away from the election, he screwed it all up. \\nIf 2016’s very ugly election has done any good it’s by exposing the utter cowardice of the Republicans who once feigned moral courage. A reality television star spit on them, hijacked their party, insulted their wives, and got every last one of them to kneel before him. What a turn of events. \\nFeatured image via Twitter

              "2  U.S. Secretary of State John F. Kerry said Monday that he will stop in Paris later this week, amid criticism that no top American officials attended Sunday’s unity march against terrorism.\\n\\nKerry said he expects to arrive in Paris Thursday evening, as he heads home after a week abroad. He said he will fly to France at the conclusion of a series of meetings scheduled for Thursday in Sofia, Bulgaria. He plans to meet the next day with Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius and President Francois Hollande, then return to Washington.\\n\\nThe visit by Kerry, who has family and childhood ties to the country and speaks fluent French, could address some of the criticism that the United States snubbed France in its darkest hour in many years.\\n\\nThe French press on Monday was filled with questions about why neither President Obama nor Kerry attended Sunday’s march, as about 40 leaders of other nations did. Obama was said to have stayed away because his own security needs can be taxing on a country, and Kerry had prior commitments.\\n\\nAmong roughly 40 leaders who did attend was Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, no stranger to intense security, who marched beside Hollande through the city streets. The highest ranking U.S. officials attending the march were Jane Hartley, the ambassador to France, and Victoria Nuland, the assistant secretary of state for European affairs. Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. was in Paris for meetings with law enforcement officials but did not participate in the march.\\n\\nKerry spent Sunday at a business summit hosted by India’s prime minister, Narendra Modi. The United States is eager for India to relax stringent laws that function as barriers to foreign investment and hopes Modi’s government will act to open the huge Indian market for more American businesses.\\n\\nIn a news conference, Kerry brushed aside criticism that the United States had not sent a more senior official to Paris as “quibbling a little bit.” He noted that many staffers of the American Embassy in Paris attended the march, including the ambassador. He said he had wanted to be present at the march himself but could not because of his prior commitments in India.\\n\\n“But that is why I am going there on the way home, to make it crystal clear how

              "3  — Kaydee King (@KaydeeKing) November 9, 2016 The lesson from tonight's Dem losses: Time for Democrats to start listening to the voters. Stop running the same establishment candidates. \\n— People For Bernie (@People4Bernie) November 9, 2016 If Dems didn't want a tight race they shouldn't have worked against Bernie. \\n— Walker Bragman (@WalkerBragman) November 9, 2016 \\nNew York Times columnist Paul Krugman, who was one of Hillary Clinton’s most outspoken surrogates during the contentious Democratic primary, blamed Clinton’s poor performance on Green Party candidate Jill Stein, who has so far received a negligible number of votes nationally, saying Stein was the Ralph Nader of 2016 in preventing a Clinton victory. The account @BerniesTeachers threw Krugman’s analysis back in his face. Your candidate was the issue. Take responsibility. https://t.co/KHyOuUSrFS \\n— Teachers for Bernie (@BerniesTeachers) November 9, 2016 \\nAna Navarro, a Republican who recently endorsed Hillary Clinton, summed up the preposterous nature of the 2016 presidential election in this tweet: GOP nominated the only damn candidate who could lose to Hillary Clinton. Democrats nominated the only damn candidate who could lose to Trump \\n— Ana Navarro (@ananavarro) November 9, 2016 \\nPopular left-wing Facebook page The Other 98%, which was pro-Sanders during the primary, responded to Trump’s surge by simply posting a meme of Sanders’ face with the text “All this could’ve been avoided. Thanks for nothing, DNC!” The meme has been shared almost 15,000 times in less than an hour: \\nPosted by The Other 98% on Tuesday, November 8, 2016 \\nWhile Bernie Sanders endorsed Hillary Clinton just before the Democratic National Convention in July, many of his supporters remained adamant in their refusal to support the DNC-anointed candidate, pointing to WikiLeaks’ revelations that top officials at the DNC had been working behind the scenes to tip the scales in Clinton’s favor by coordinating with media figures to circulate anti-Sanders narratives. \\nRather than attribute a potential Trump presidency to the GOP nominee’s perceived popularity among voters, the closeness of this election could be credited to Hillary Clinton’s unfavorable ratings. According to RealClearPolitics, anywhere between 51 and 57 percent of voters had a negative opinion of the Democratic nominee. \\nAs of 11 PM Eastern, Florida, Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin remain too close to call. Clinton has 197 electoral votes to Trump’s 187. \\n\\nZach Cartwright is an activist and author from Richmond, Virginia. He enjoys writing about politics, government, and the media.

              "4  It's primary day in New York and front-runners Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump are leading in the polls.\\n\\nTrump is now vowing to win enough delegates to clinch the Republican nomination and prevent a contested convention. But Sens.Ted Cruz, R-Texas, Bernie Sanders, D-Vt., and Ohio Gov. John Kasich and aren't giving up just yet.\\n\\nA big win in New York could tip the scales for both the Republican and Democratic front-runners in this year's race for the White House. Clinton and Trump have each suffered losses in recent contests, shifting the momentum to their rivals.\\n\\n\"We have won eight out of the last nine caucuses and primaries! Cheer!\" Sanders recently told supporters.\\n\\nWhile wins in New York for Trump and Clinton are expected, the margins of those victories are also important.\\n\\nTrump needs to capture more than 50 percent of the vote statewide if he wants to be positioned to win all of the state's 95 GOP delegates. That would put him one step closer to avoiding a contested convention.\\n\\n\"We've got to vote and you know Cruz is way, way down in the polls,\" Trump urged supporters.\\n\\nMeanwhile, Sanders is hoping for a close race in the Empire State. A loss by 10 points means he'll need to win 80 percent of the remaining delegates to clinch the nomination.\\n\\nDespite a predicted loss in New York, Cruz hasn't lost momentum. He's hoping to sweep up more delegates this weekend while he's talking about how he can win in November.\\n\\n\"Because if I'm the nominee, we win the General Election,\" Cruz promised his supporters. \"We're beating Hillary in the key swing states, we're beating Hillary with Independents, we're beating Hillary with young people.\"\\n\\nFor now, Cruz, Kasich, and Sanders have all moved on from New York to other states. Trump and Clinton are the only two staying in their home state to watch the results come in.

              "5    \\nI’m not an immigrant, but my grandparents are. More than 50 years ago, they arrived in New York City from Iran. I grew up mainly in central New Jersey, an American kid playing little league for the Raritan Red Sox and soccer for the Raritan Rovers. In 1985, I travelled with my family to our ancestral land. I was only eight, but old enough to understand that the Iranians had lost their liberty and freedom. I saw the abject despair of a people who, in a desperate attempt to bring about change, had ushered in nationalist tyrants led by Ayatollah Khomeini. \\nWhat I witnessed during that year in Iran changed the course of my life. In 1996, at age 19, wanting to help preserve the blessings of liberty and freedom we enjoy in America, I enlisted in the U.S. Navy. Now, with the rise of Donald Trump and his nationalist alt-right movement, I’ve come to feel that the values I sought to protect are in jeopardy. \\nIn Iran, theocratic fundmentalists sowed division and hatred of outsiders — of Westerners, Christians, and other religious minorities. Here in America, the right wing seems to have stolen passages directly from their playbook as it spreads hatred of immigrants, particularly Muslim ones. This form of nationalistic bigotry — Islamophobia — threatens the heart of our nation. When I chose to serve in the military, I did so to protect what I viewed as our sacred foundational values of liberty, equality, and democracy. Now, 20 years later, I’ve joined forces with fellow veterans to again fight for those sacred values, this time right here at home. \\n“Death to America!” \\nAs a child, I sat in my class at the international school one sunny morning and heard in the distance the faint sounds of gunfire and rising chants of “Death to America!” That day would define the rest of my life. \\nIt was Tehran, the capital of Iran, in 1985. I was attending a unique school for bilingual students who had been born in Western nations. It had become the last refuge in that city with any tolerance for Western teaching, but that also made it a target for military fundamentalists. As the gunfire drew closer, I heard boots pounding the marble tiles outside, marching into our building, and thundering down the corridor toward my classroom. As I heard voices chanting “Death to America!” I remember wondering if I would survive to see my parents again. \\nIn a flash of green and black uniforms, those soldiers rushed into our classroom, grabbed us by our shirt collars, and yelled at us to get outside. We were then packed into the school’s courtyard where a soldier pointed his rifle at our group and commanded us to look up. Almost in unison, my classmates and I raised our eyes and saw the flags of our many nations being torn down and dangled from the balcony, then set ablaze and tossed, still burning, into the courtyard. As those flags floated to the ground in flames, the soldiers fired their guns in the air. Shouting, they ordered us — if we ever wanted to see our families again — to swear allegiance to the Grand Ayatollah Khomeini and trample on the remains of the burning symbols of our home countries. I scanned the smoke that was filling the courtyard for my friends and classmates and, horrified, watched them capitulate and begin to chant, “Death to America!” as they stomped on our sacred symbols. \\nI was so angry that, young as I was, I began to plead with them to come to their senses. No one paid the slightest attention to an eight year old and yet, for the first time in my life, I felt something like righteous indignation. I suspect that, born and raised in America, I was already imbued with such a sense of privilege that I just couldn’t fathom the immense danger I was in. Certainly, I was acting in ways no native Iranian would have found reasonable. \\nAcross the smoke-filled courtyard, I saw a soldier coming at me and knew he meant to force me to submit. I spotted an American flag still burning, dropped to my knees, and grabbed the charred pieces from underneath a classmate’s feet. As the soldier closed in on me, I ducked and ran, still clutching my charred pieces of flag into a crowd of civilians who had gathered to witness the commotion. The events of that day would come to define all that I have ever stood for — or against. \\n“Camel Jockey,” “Ayatollah,” and “Gandhi” \\nMy parents and I soon returned to the United States and I entered third grade. More than anything, I just wanted to be normal, to fit in and be accepted by my peers. Unfortunately, my first name, Nader (which I changed to Nate upon joining the Navy), and my swarthy Middle Eastern appearance, were little help on that score, eliciting regular jibes from my classmates. Even at that young age, they had already mastered a veritable thesaurus of ethnic defamation, including “camel jockey,” “sand-nigger,” “raghead,” “ayatollah,” and ironically, “Gandhi” (which I now take as a compliment). My classmates regularly sought to “other-ize” me in those years, as if I were a lesser American because of my faith and ethnicity. \\nYet I remember that tingling in my chest when I first donned my Cub Scout uniform — all because of the American flag patch on its shoulder. Something felt so good about wearing it, a feeling I still had when I joined the military. It seems that the flag I tried to rescue in Tehran was stapled to my heart, or that’s how I felt anyway as I wore my country’s uniform. \\nWhen I took my oath of enlistment in the U.S. Navy, I gave my mom a camera and asked her to take some photos, but she was so overwhelmed with pride and joy that she cried throughout the ceremony and managed to snap only a few images of the carpet. She cried even harder when I was selected to serve as the first Muslim-American member of the U.S. Navy Presidential Ceremonial Honor Guard . On that day, I was proud, too, and all the taunts of those bullies of my childhood seemed finally silenced. \\nBeing tormented because of my ethnicity and religion in those early years had another effect on me. It caused me to become unusually sensitive to the nature of other people. Somehow, I grasped that, if it weren’t for a fear of the unknown, there was an inherent goodness and frail humanity lurking in many of the kids who bullied and harassed me. Often, I discovered, those same bullies could be tremendously kind to their families, friends, or even strangers. I realized, then, that if, despite everything, I could lay myself bare and trust them enough to reach out in kindness, I might in turn gain their trust and they might then see me, too, and stop operating from such a place of fear and hate. \\nThrough patience, humor, and understanding, I was able to offer myself as the embodiment of my people and somehow defang the “otherness” of so much that Americans found scary. To this day, I have friends from elementary school, middle school, high school, and the military who tell me that I am the only Muslim they have ever known and that, had they not met me, their perspective on Islam would have been wholly subject to the prevailing fear-based narrative that has poisoned this country since September 11, 2001. \\nIn 1998, I became special assistant to the Master Chief Petty Officer of the Navy and then, in 1999, I was recruited to serve at the Defense Intelligence Agency. In August 2000, I transferred to the Naval Reserve. \\nIn the wake of 9/11, I began to observe how so many of my fellow Americans were adopting a fundamentalist “us vs. them” attitude towards Muslims and Islam. I suddenly found myself in an America where the scattered insults I had endured as a child took on an overarching and sinister meaning and form, where they became something like an ideology and way of life. \\nBy the time I completed my military service in 2006, I had begun to understand that our policies in the Middle East,similarly disturbed, seemed in pursuit of little more than perpetual warfare. That, in turn, was made possible by the creation of a new enemy: Islam — or rather of a portrait, painted by the powers-that-be, of Islam as a terror religion, as a hooded villain lurking out there somewhere in the desert, waiting to destroy us. I knew that attempting to dispel, through the patient approach of my childhood, the kind of Islamophobia that now had the country by the throat was not going to be enough. Post-9/11 attacks on Muslims in the U.S. and elsewhere were not merely childish taunts. \\nFor the first time in my life, in a country gripped by fear, I believed I was witnessing a shift, en masse, toward an American fundamentalism and ultra-nationalism that reflected a wanton lack of reason, not to mention fact. As a boy in Iran, I had witnessed the dark destination down which such a path could take a country. Now, it seemed to me, in America’s quest to escape the very demons we had sown by our own misadventures in the Middle East, and forsaking the hallmarks of our founding, we risked becoming everything we sought to defeat. \\nThe Boy in the Schoolyard Grown Up \\nOn February 10, 2015, three young American students, Yusor Abu-Salha, Razan Abu-Salha, and Deah Shaddy Barakat, were executed at an apartment complex in Chapel Hill, North Carolina. The killer was a gun-crazy white man filled with hate and described by his own daughter as “a monster.” Those assassinations struck a special chord of sorrow and loss in me. My mom and I cried and prayed together for those students and their families. \\nThe incident in Chapel Hill also awoke in me some version of the righteous indignation I had felt so many years earlier in that smoke-filled courtyard in Iran. I would be damned if I stood by while kids in my country were murdered simply because of their faith. It violated every word of the oath I had taken when I joined the military and desecrated every value I held in my heart as a sacred tenet of our nation. White nationalists and bigots had, by then, thrown down the gauntlet for so much of this, using Islamophobia to trigger targeted assassinations in the United States. This was terrorism, pure and simple, inspired by hate-speakers here at home. \\nAt that moment, I reached out to fellow veterans who, I thought, might be willing to help — and it’s true what they say about soul mates being irrevocably drawn to each other. When I contacted Veterans For Peace , an organization dedicated to exposing the costs of war and militarism, I found the leadership well aware of the inherent dangers of Islamophobia and of the need to confront this new enemy. So Executive Director Michael McPhearson formed a committee of vets from around the country to decide how those of us who had donned uniforms to defend this land could best battle the phenomenon — and I, of course, joined it. \\nFrom that committee emerged Veterans Challenge Islamophobia (VCI). It now has organizers in Arizona, Georgia, New Jersey, and Texas, and that’s just a beginning. Totally nonpartisan, VCI focuses on politicians of any party who engage in hate speech. We’ve met with leaders of American Muslim communities, sat with them through Ramadan, and attended their Iftar dinners to break our fasts together. In the wake of the Orlando shooting , we at VCI also mobilized to fight back against attempts to pit the Muslim community against the LGBTQ+ community. \\nOur group was born of the belief that, as American military veterans, we had a responsibility to call out bigotry, hatred, and the perpetuation of endless warfare. We want the American Muslim community to know that they have allies, and that those allies are indeed veterans as well. We stand with them and for them and, for those of us who are Muslim, among them. \\nNationalism and xenophobia have no place in American life, and I, for my part, don’t think Donald Trump or anyone like him should be able to peddle Islamophobia in an attempt to undermine our national unity. Without Islamophobia, there no longer exists a “clash of civilizations.” Without Islamophobia, whatever the problems in the world may be, there is no longer an “us vs. them” and it’s possible to begin reimagining a world of something other than perpetual war. \\nAs of now, this remains the struggle of my life, for despite my intense love for America, some of my countrymen increasingly see American Muslims as the “other,” the enemy. \\nMy Mom taught me as a boy that the only thing that mattered was what was in my heart. Now, with her in mind and as a representative of VCI, when I meet fellow Americans I always remember my childhood experiences with my bullying peers. And I still lay myself bare, as I did then. I give trust to gain trust, but always knowing that these days this isn’t just a matter of niceties. It’s a question of life or death. It’s part of a battle for the soul of our nation. \\nIn many ways, I still consider myself that boy in the school courtyard in Tehran trying to rescue charred pieces of that flag from those trampling feet. It’s just that now I’m doing it in my own country. \\nNate Terani is a veteran of the U.S. Navy and served in military intelligence with the Defense Intelligence Agency.

              "6  Share This Baylee Luciani (left), Screenshot of what Baylee caught on FaceTime (right) \\nThe closest Baylee Luciani could get to her boyfriend, who’s attending college in Austin, was through video online chat. The couple had regular “dates” this way to bridge the 200-mile distance between them. However, the endearing arrangement quickly came to an end after his FaceTime was left on and caught something that left his girlfriend horrified. \\nBaylee had been discussing regular things with her boyfriend, Yale Gerstein, who was on the other side of the screen on an otherwise average evening. This video chat was not unlike all the others she had with Yale from his apartment near Austin Community College until the 19-year-old girlfriend heard some scratching sounds after FaceTime had been left on. \\nAccording to KRON , Baylee was mid-conversation with Yale when scratches at the door caught both of their attention and he got up from his bed, where the computer was, to see who was at his door. He barely turned the handle to open in when masked men entered the room and beat Yale’s face in and slammed him down on his bed while shoving a pistol in his cheek. The intruders didn’t seem to know or care that FaceTime was still on and Baylee’s face, seen in the corner, was watching everything, terrified that she was about to see her boyfriend murdered in front of her, as she watched him fight for his life. \\nAdmitting that she first thought it was a joke, seconds later, she came to the horrid realization that he was being robbed and called her dad, who was at home with her in Dallas, into the room. “I was scared, because they were saying I’m going to blow your head off, I’m going to kill you,” Baylee explained along with the chilling feeling she got when the intruder finally realized the video chat was running and looked right at her in the camera. “I’m like wow… seriously watching an armed robbery happen to somebody that I care about,” she added. Screengrabs of intruder forcing Yale down on his bed while Baylee and her father watch on FaceTime in horror \\nWith a clear view of at least one intruder’s face, Baylee began taking screenshots of the suspect in the act as she and her dad called the police to report what was going on. She got the pictures right in time since, seconds later, the intruder decided to disconnect the computer as he and the suspects took off with thousands of dollars worth of Yale’s music equipment. Although the boyfriend’s life was spared in the traumatizing ordeal for the two of them, he said that the thieves took something from him that can’t be replaced. \\n“I had just finished my first album as a solo artist,” Yale said. “That’s all lost,” since they took the recordings on the equipment, which means nothing to the thieves and everything to the victim. It’s not often that you hear of FaceTime solving crimes or potentially saving lives, which is what happened in this case. Although it was difficult to watch, Baylee, being there through technology, was an instrumental part in protecting Yale, who hopefully learned that he better take advantage of Texas’ great gun laws and arm himself with more than just a computer.

              "7  A Czech stockbroker who saved more than 650 Jewish children from Nazi Germany has died at the age of 106. Dubbed “Britain’s Schindler,” Nicholas Winton arranged to transport Jewish youngsters from Prague after Germany annexed Czechoslovakia in March 1939. Though the children were originally set to arrive in Britain by plane, the German invasion forced Winton to transport them by train through Germany before they eventually reached England by boat. Winton arranged eight trains, known as the Kindertransports (children’s transports), to evacuate the children, and died on the anniversary of the 1939 departure of the one carrying the largest number of children: 241. Winton was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II in 2003 for his efforts, despite keeping it secret for nearly 50 years.

              "8  Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump made some inaccurate claims during an NBC “commander-in-chief” forum on military and veterans issues:\\n\\n• Clinton wrongly claimed Trump supported the war in Iraq after it started, while Trump was wrong, once again, in saying he was against the war before it started.\\n\\n• Trump said that President Obama set a “certain date” for withdrawing troops from Iraq, when that date was set before Obama was sworn in.\\n\\n• Trump said that Obama’s visits to China, Saudi Arabia and Cuba were “the first time in the history, the storied history of Air Force One” when “high officials” of a host country did not appear to greet the president. Not true.\\n\\n• Clinton said that Trump supports privatizing the Veterans Health Administration. That’s false. Trump said he supports allowing veterans to seek care at either public or private hospitals.\\n\\n• Trump said Clinton made “a terrible mistake on Libya” when she was secretary of State. But, at the time, Trump also supported U.S. action that led to the removal of Moammar Gadhafi from power.\\n\\n• Trump cherry-picked Clinton’s words when he claimed Clinton said “vets are being treated, essentially, just fine.” Clinton had said the problems in the Department of Veterans Affairs were not as “widespread” as some Republicans claimed, but she went on to acknowledge problems, including the issue of wait times for doctors.\\n\\nThe forum, sponsored by NBC News and the Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America, was held Sept. 7 at the Intrepid Sea, Air & Space Museum in New York City. Today show host Matt Lauer, and members of the military and veterans in the audience, questioned the candidates separately.\\n\\nTrump said he “was totally against the war in Iraq,” while Clinton claimed that he supported the Iraq War before and after it started. The facts don’t support either candidate’s strong assertions.\\n\\nOur review of Trump’s statements before and after the Iraq War started found no evidence that Trump opposed the war before it started. In fact, he expressed mild support for invading Iraq when asked about it on the Howard Stern radio show on Sept. 11, 2002 — about six months before the war started.\\n\\nStern asked Trump if he supported a war with Iraq, and Trump responded, “Yeah, I guess so.”\\n\\nIn the NBC commander in chief forum, Trump cited an Esquire article that appeared in August 2004 to show his opposition to the war. But that article appeared 17 months after the war started.\\n\\nAs for Clinton, who as a senator voted in October 2002 to authorize the war in Iraq, the Democratic nominee claimed that Trump “supported it before it happened, he supported it as it was happening and he is on record as supporting it after it happened.”\\n\\nBut just as there is no evidence that Trump opposed the Iraq War before it started, the Clinton campaign offered no evidence that Trump supported the war “after it happened.”\\n\\nThe Clinton campaign cited Trump’s interview on March 21, 2003, with Neil Cavuto of Fox Business just two days after the war started.\\n\\nCavuto asked Trump about the impact of the war on the stock market. Trump said the war “looks like a tremendous success from a military standpoint,” and he predicted the market will “go up like a rocket” after the war. But Cavuto does not ask Trump whether the U.S. should have gone to war with Iraq or whether he supports the war, and Trump doesn’t offer an opinion.\\n\\nAs early as July 2003, Trump expressed concern on Hardball with Chris Matthews about money being spent in Iraq rather than in the U.S. Two months later, Trump told MSNBC’s Joe Scarborough, “I guess maybe if I had to do it, I would have fought terrorism but not necessarily Iraq.”\\n\\nClinton invited her audience to read Trump’s comments on the Iraq War. They can read our timeline, “Donald Trump and the Iraq War.”\\n\\nTrump said President Obama set a “certain date” for withdrawing troops from Iraq, but that date was actually set by President George W. Bush.\\n\\nNBC’s Matt Lauer asked Trump about his tendency to respond, when pushed for details on his military proposals, that he’s not going to give details because he wants to be “unpredictable.” Trump responded, “Absolutely,” and went on to criticize Obama for revealing the withdrawal date.\\n\\nAs we said then, Republicans and Democrats disagree on whether Obama or Bush is to blame for withdrawing all combat troops from Iraq at the end of 2011. But that date was set when Bush signed the Status of Forces Agreement on Dec. 14, 2008. It said: “All the United States Forces shall withdraw from all Iraqi territory no later than December 31, 2011.”\\n\\nIn the NBC forum, Trump also called the withdrawal of troops “a terrible decision.” As we’ve explained before, Condoleezza Rice, Bush’s secretary of State, later wrote that Bush wanted an agreement for a residual force to remain, but Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki objected.\\n\\nOnce Obama took office in January 2009, he had three years to renegotiate the deal, which his administration tried to do, to leave a residual American troop force. But Maliki still didn’t agree. Negotiations broke down in October 2011 over the issue of whether U.S. troops would be shielded from criminal prosecution by Iraqi authorities. Whether Obama did enough is a matter of opinion: His then defense secretary, Leon Panetta, later wrote that the president didn’t press hard enough for a deal. But some experts say Iraq was more closely aligned at the time with Iran and there wasn’t a deal to be made with Maliki.\\n\\nSo, both presidents had a role in the withdrawal of troops. But Trump wrongly said that Obama was the one who set a “certain date” for withdrawal and let U.S. enemies know about it, when that date was set before Obama was sworn in.\\n\\nIt’s worth noting that Trump said in a March 16, 2007, interview on CNN that the troops should be withdrawn quickly from Iraq.\\n\\nTrump said that Obama’s visits to China, Saudi Arabia and Cuba were “the first time in the history, the storied history of Air Force One” when “high officials” of a host country did not appear to greet the president.\\n\\nThat’s not true. Other presidents have encountered similar low-key greetings on foreign trips aboard the presidential aircraft.\\n\\nTrump referred to the fact that Cuba’s president, Raul Castro, did not greet Obama at the airport on his historic visit to Cuba in March, that Saudi Arabia’s King Salman did not meet Air Force One at the start of Obama’s trip to Riyadh in April, and he referred to China’s handling of the president’s arrival in Hangzhou last Saturday for a Group of 20 meeting.\\n\\nWhether or not those arrivals constituted snubs of a U.S. president as Trump claims is a matter of debate. But Trump is wrong on the facts when he claims it has not happened before. It has.\\n\\nIn 1984, for example, Ronald Reagan landed in Beijing and was received by China’s foreign minister rather than the president, whom he met only later. Similarly, on a 1985 trip to West Germany, Reagan was met by the foreign minister and not Chancellor Helmut Kohl.\\n\\nThese and other examples were dug up by our friend Glenn Kessler, the Washington Post‘s “Fact Checker,” who researched a Trump claim in April that Cuba’s and Saudi Arabia’s handling of Obama’s visits were “without precedent.” Kessler said of Trump, “once again he’s wrong, wrong, wrong.”\\n\\nKessler also noted that during Richard Nixon’s historic 1972 visit to China he was greeted at the airport by the country’s number two man, Premier Zhou Enlai. His boss, Chairman Mao, didn’t even agree to meet with Nixon until after he had arrived at a guest house.\\n\\nClinton said that her plan to overhaul the Veterans Health Administration would not include privatization, which she said Trump supports.\\n\\nBut Trump refuted that statement when it was his turn to discuss his plan to help veterans. “I would not do that,” Trump said, referring to Clinton’s claim that he supports privatization.\\n\\nTrump’s campaign published “The Goals Of Donald J. Trump’s Veterans Plan” on its website last October. It doesn’t call for the VA to be completely privatized.\\n\\nOne of the biggest changes that plan would make to the current VA health care system is allowing veterans to get care at any non-VA medical center that accepts Medicare.\\n\\n“Under a Trump Administration, all veterans eligible for VA health care can bring their veteran’s ID card to any doctor or care facility that accepts Medicare to get the care they need immediately,” the plan states.\\n\\n“The power to choose will stop the wait time backlogs and force the VA to improve and compete if the department wants to keep receiving veterans’ healthcare dollars,” the plan says.\\n\\nTrump’s proposal would seemingly go further than the Non-VA Medical Care Program, which allows eligible veterans to access care outside of the VA under certain circumstances, such as when VA medical centers cannot provide services. The program requires pre-approval for veterans to receive care at a non-VA facility in non-emergency situations.\\n\\nTrump’s proposal would also go further than the bipartisan Veterans Choice Act of 2014 that President Obama signed into law, creating a temporary program, separate from the Non-VA Medical Care Program, that allows eligible veterans to receive health care at a non-VA facility if they would have to wait more than 30 days for an appointment at a VA medical center, or if they live more than 40 miles from the nearest VA hospital.\\n\\nTrump stuck to the idea of allowing veterans to choose between public and private hospitals when he released his most recent “Ten Point Plan To Reform The VA” in July.\\n\\nPoint 10 of the plan says: “Mr. Trump will ensure every veteran has the choice to seek care at the VA or at a private service provider of their own choice. Under a Trump Administration, no veteran will die waiting for service.”\\n\\nTrump reinforced that part of his plan during the NBC News forum as well.\\n\\nTo be clear, Trump supports giving veterans a choice between VA hospitals and private ones. That’s not the same thing as supporting the complete privatization of the system that provides care to veterans.\\n\\nTrump criticized Clinton for making “a terrible mistake on Libya” when she was secretary of State. But, at the time, Trump also supported U.S. action that led to the removal of Moammar Gadhafi from power.\\n\\nTrump made his claim in response to a question posed by Lauer on whether Trump will be “prepared on Day One,” if elected president, to tackle “complex national security issues.”\\n\\nThis isn’t the first time Trump has ignored his past support for the U.S. intervention in Libya.\\n\\nDuring the 10th GOP debate, Trump said he had “never discussed that subject” when Sen. Ted Cruz called him out on supporting U.S. action in the country. But, as we wrote, Trump said in 2011 that the U.S. should go into Libya “on a humanitarian basis” and “knock [Gadhafi] out very quickly, very surgically, very effectively and save the lives.”\\n\\nTrump made that comment in a video posted to his YouTube channel in February 2011:\\n\\nEven though Trump now says Clinton’s support for intervention in Libya was a “terrible mistake,” it doesn’t change the fact that five years ago he supported Gadhafi’s removal.\\n\\nTrump twisted Clinton’s words when he claimed Clinton said “vets are being treated, essentially, just fine.” Clinton said the problems in the Department of Veterans Affairs were not as “widespread” as some Republican supporters of privatization of the VA claim, but she went on to acknowledge problems in the VA system — including the issue of wait times for doctors — and what she would do to address them.\\n\\nTrump highlighted the issue of wait times to see a doctor as “one of the big problems” in the VA, and then suggested Clinton doesn’t think the VA has problems.\\n\\nLauer interrupted, noting that Clinton “went on after that and laid out a litany of problems within the VA.”\\n\\nTrump insisted his version was accurate, adding, “I’m telling you … she said she was satisfied with what was going on in the Veterans Administration.”\\n\\nThat’s not accurate. The comments in question from Clinton came during an interview with MSNBC’s Rachel Maddow on Oct. 23, 2015. Maddow asked about talk among some Republicans of abolishing the VA and privatizing it. “The reason they are able to propose something that radical is because the problems at the VA seem so intractable,” Maddow said.\\n\\nMaddow asked if Clinton had any “new ideas for trying to fix” the VA. Here was Clinton’s response, with the part Trump is referring to in bold.\\n\\nClinton accused Republicans of underfunding the VA because they “want it to fail” so they can privatize it.\\n\\nClinton added, “But we have to be more creative about trying to fix the problems that are the legitimate concern, so that we can try to stymie the Republican assault.”\\n\\nIndeed, the Clinton campaign website states that Clinton wants to “fundamentally reform veterans’ health care to ensure access to timely and high quality care.” The campaign says Clinton “was outraged by the recent scandals at the VA, and as president, she will demand accountability and performance from VA leadership.” The site specifically mentions Clinton’s dissatisfaction that “[m]any veterans have to wait an unacceptably long time to see a doctor or to process disability claims and appeals” and promises she will “[b]uild a 21st-century Department of Veterans Affairs to deliver world-class care.”\\n\\nTrump cherry-picked the part of Clinton’s response that said problems in the VA have “not been as widespread as it has been made out to be,” to make the blanket claim that Clinton is “satisfied with what was going on in the Veterans Administration” and that “vets are being treated, essentially, just fine.” But Trump is leaving out the parts of Clinton’s answer that acknowledged problems in the VA — including the wait time issue Trump highlighted as one of his biggest concerns.   \n",
              "9  Iranian negotiators reportedly have made a last-ditch push for more concessions from the U.S. and five other world powers as talks on the fate of Iran's nuclear program come down to the final days before a crucial deadline.\\n\\nThe New York Times reported late Sunday that Tehran had backed away from a tentative promise to ship a large portion of its uranium stockpile to Russia, where it could not be used as part of any future weapons program. Western officials insisted to the paper that the uranium did not have to be sent overseas, but could be disposed of in other ways.\\n\\nThe new twist in the talks comes just two days before the deadline for both sides to agree on a framework for a permanent deal. The final deadline for a permanent deal would not arrive until the end of June.\\n\\nHowever, if Iran insists on keeping its uranium in the country, it would undermine a key argument made in favor of the deal by the Obama administration. The Times reports that if the uranium had gone to Russia, it would have been converted into fuel rods, which are difficult to use in nuclear weapons. It is not clear what would happen to the uranium if it remained in Iran.\\n\\nThe Associated Press reported Sunday that Iran's position had shifted from from demanding that it be allowed to keep nearly 10,000 centrifuges enriching uranium, to agreeing to keep 6,000. Western officials involved in the talks told the Associated Press that Tehran may be ready to accept an even lower number.\\n\\nThe United States and its allies want a deal that extends the time Iran would need to make a nuclear weapon from the present two months to three months to at least a year. However, The Times reported Sunday that a paper published by Olli Heinonen, former head of inspections for the U.N.'s nuclear watchdog, estimated that Iran could still develop a nuclear weapon in seven or eight months with around 6,500 centrifuges.\\n\\nTehran says it wants to enrich uranium only for energy, science, industry and medicine. But many countries fear Iran could use the technology to make weapons-grade uranium.\\n\\nOfficials told the Associated Press that another main dispute involved the length of an agreement. Iran, they said, wants a total lifting of all caps on its activities after 10 years, while the U.S. and the five other nations at the talks — Russia, China, Britain, France and Germany — insist on progressive removal after a decade.\\n\\nA senior U.S. official characterized the issue as lack of agreement on what happens in years 11 to 15. The official spoke on condition of anonymity in line with State Department rules on briefing about the closed-door talks.\\n\\nLimits on Iran's research and development of centrifuges also were unresolved, the Western officials said.\\n\\nTehran has created a prototype centrifuge that it says enriches uranium 16 times faster than its present mainstay model. The U.S. and its partners want to constrain research that would increase greatly the speed of making enough weapons-grade uranium for a bomb, once limits on Iran's programs are lifted.\\n\\nOne official said Russia opposed the U.S. position that any U.N. penalties lifted in the course of a deal should be reimposed quickly if Tehran reneged on any commitments.\\n\\nBoth Western officials said Iran was resisting attempts to make inspections and other ways of verification as intrusive as possible.\\n\\nThere was tentative agreement on turning a nearly-finished reactor into a model that gives off less plutonium waste than originally envisaged. Plutonium, like enriched uranium, is a path to nuclear weapons.\\n\\nIran and the U.S. were discussing letting Iran run centrifuges at an underground bunker that has been used to enrich uranium. The machines would produce isotopes for peaceful applications, the officials said.\\n\\nWith the Tuesday deadline approaching and problems remaining, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry canceled plans Sunday to return to the United States for an event honoring the late U.S. Sen. Edward Kennedy. French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius and Frank-Walter Steinmeier, his German counterpart, scratched planned trips to Kazakhstan.\\n\\nKerry has been in discussions with Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif since Thursday.\\n\\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.\\n\\nClick for more from The New York Times.

              "0       Daniel Greenfield a Shillman Journalism Fellow at the Freedom Center is a New York writer focusing on radical Islam  In the final stretch of the election Hillary Rodham Clinton has gone to war with the FBI  The word “unprecedented” has been thrown around so often this election that it ought to be retired But it s still unprecedented for the nominee of a major political party to go war with the FBI  But that s exactly what Hillary and her people have done Coma patients just waking up now and watching an hour of CNN from their hospital beds would assume that FBI Director James Comey is Hillary s opponent in this election  The FBI is under attack by everyone from Obama to CNN Hillary s people have circulated a letter attacking Comey There are currently more media hit pieces lambasting him than targeting Trump It wouldn t be too surprising if the Clintons or their allies were to start running attack ads against the FBI  The FBI s leadership is being warned that the entire leftwing establishment will form a lynch mob if they continue going after Hillary And the FBI s credibility is being attacked by the media and the Democrats to preemptively head off the results of the investigation of the Clinton Foundation and Hillary Clinton  The covert struggle between FBI agents and Obama s DOJ people has gone explosively public  The New York Times has compared Comey to J Edgar Hoover Its bizarre headline “James Comey Role Recalls Hoover s FBI Fairly or Not” practically admits up front that it s spouting nonsense The Boston Globe has published a column calling for Comey s resignation Not to be outdone Time has an editorial claiming that the scandal is really an attack on all women  James Carville appeared on MSNBC to remind everyone that he was still alive and insane He accused Comey of coordinating with House Republicans and the KGB And you thought the “vast right wing conspiracy” was a stretch  Countless media stories charge Comey with violating procedure Do you know what s a procedural violation Emailing classified information stored on your bathroom server  Senator Harry Reid has sent Comey a letter accusing him of violating the Hatch Act The Hatch Act is a nice idea that has as much relevance in the age of Obama as the Tenth Amendment But the cable news spectrum quickly filled with media hacks glancing at the Wikipedia article on the Hatch Act under the table while accusing the FBI director of one of the most awkward conspiracies against Hillary ever  If James Comey is really out to hurt Hillary he picked one hell of a strange way to do it  Not too long ago Democrats were breathing a sigh of relief when he gave Hillary Clinton a pass in a prominent public statement If he really were out to elect Trump by keeping the email scandal going why did he trash the investigation Was he on the payroll of House Republicans and the KGB back then and playing it coy or was it a sudden development where Vladimir Putin and Paul Ryan talked him into taking a look at Anthony Weiner s computer  Either Comey is the most cunning FBI director that ever lived or he s just awkwardly trying to navigate a political mess that has trapped him between a DOJ leadership whose political futures are tied to Hillary s victory and his own bureau whose apolitical agents just want to be allowed to do their jobs  The only truly mysterious thing is why Hillary and her associates decided to go to war with a respected Federal agency Most Americans like the FBI while Hillary Clinton enjoys a 60 unfavorable rating  And it s an interesting question  Hillary s old strategy was to lie and deny that the FBI even had a criminal investigation underway Instead her associates insisted that it was a security review The FBI corrected her and she shrugged it off But the old breezy denial approach has given way to a savage assault on the FBI  Pretending that nothing was wrong was a bad strategy but it was a better one that picking a fight with the FBI while lunatic Clinton associates try to claim that the FBI is really the KGB  There are two possible explanations  Hillary Clinton might be arrogant enough to lash out at the FBI now that she believes that victory is near The same kind of hubris that led her to plan her victory fireworks display could lead her to declare a war on the FBI for irritating her during the final miles of her campaign  But the other explanation is that her people panicked  Going to war with the FBI is not the behavior of a smart and focused presidential campaign It s an act of desperation When a presidential candidate decides that her only option is to try and destroy the credibility of the FBI that s not hubris it s fear of what the FBI might be about to reveal about her  During the original FBI investigation Hillary Clinton was confident that she could ride it out And she had good reason for believing that But that Hillary Clinton is gone In her place is a paranoid wreck Within a short space of time the “positive” Clinton campaign promising to unite the country has been replaced by a desperate and flailing operation that has focused all its energy on fighting the FBI  There s only one reason for such bizarre behavior  The Clinton campaign has decided that an FBI investigation of the latest batch of emails poses a threat to its survival And so it s gone all in on fighting the FBI It s an unprecedented step born of fear It s hard to know whether that fear is justified But the existence of that fear already tells us a whole lot  Clinton loyalists rigged the old investigation They knew the outcome ahead of time as well as they knew the debate questions Now suddenly they are no longer in control And they are afraid  You can smell the fear  The FBI has wiretaps from the investigation of the Clinton Foundation It s finding new emails all the time And Clintonworld panicked The spinmeisters of Clintonworld have claimed that the email scandal is just so much smoke without fire All that s here is the appearance of impropriety without any of the substance But this isn t how you react to smoke It s how you respond to a fire  The misguided assault on the FBI tells us that Hillary Clinton and her allies are afraid of a revelation bigger than the fundamental illegality of her email setup The email setup was a preemptive cover up The Clinton campaign has panicked badly out of the belief right or wrong that whatever crime the illegal setup was meant to cover up is at risk of being exposed  The Clintons have weathered countless scandals over the years Whatever they are protecting this time around is bigger than the usual corruption bribery sexual assaults and abuses of power that have followed them around throughout the years This is bigger and more damaging than any of the allegations that have already come out And they don t want FBI investigators anywhere near it  The campaign against Comey is pure intimidation It s also a warning Any senior FBI people who value their careers are being warned to stay away The Democrats are closing ranks around their nominee against the FBI It s an ugly and unprecedented scene It may also be their last stand  Hillary Clinton has awkwardly wound her way through numerous scandals in just this election cycle But she s never shown fear or desperation before Now that has changed Whatever she is afraid of it lies buried in her emails with Huma Abedin And it can bring her down like nothing else has

              "1       Google Pinterest Digg Linkedin Reddit Stumbleupon Print Delicious Pocket Tumblr  There are two fundamental truths in this world Paul Ryan desperately wants to be president And Paul Ryan will never be president Today proved it  In a particularly staggering example of political cowardice Paul Ryan rererereversed course and announced that he was back on the Trump Train after all This was an aboutface from where he was a few weeks ago He had previously declared he would not be supporting or defending Trump after a tape was made public in which Trump bragged about assaulting women Suddenly Ryan was appearing at a proTrump rally and boldly declaring that he already sent in his vote to make him President of the United States It was a surreal moment The figurehead of the Republican Party dosed himself in gasoline got up on a stage on a chilly afternoon in Wisconsin and lit a match  SpeakerRyan says he voted for realDonaldTrump  “Republicans it is time to come home” httpstcoVyTT49YvoE pictwittercomwCvSCg4a5I    ABC News Politics ABCPolitics November 5 2016  The Democratic Party couldn t have asked for a better moment of film Ryan s chances of ever becoming president went down to zero in an instant In the wreckage Trump is to leave behind in his wake those who cravenly backed his campaign will not recover If Ryan s career manages to limp all the way to 2020 then the DNC will have this tape locked and loaded to be used in every ad until Election Day  The ringing endorsement of the man he clearly hates on a personal level speaks volumes about his own spinelessness Ryan has postured himself as a “principled” conservative and one uncomfortable with Trump s unapologetic bigotry and sexism However when push came to shove Paul Ryan  like many of his colleagues  turned into a sniveling appeaser After all his lofty tak about conviction his principles were a house of cards and collapsed with the slightest breeze  What s especially bizarre is how close Ryan came to making it through unscathed For months the Speaker of the House refused to comment on Trump at all His strategy seemed to be to keep his head down pretend Trump didn t exist and hope that nobody remembered what happened in 2016 Now just days away from the election he screwed it all up  If 2016 s very ugly election has done any good it s by exposing the utter cowardice of the Republicans who once feigned moral courage A reality television star spit on them hijacked their party insulted their wives and got every last one of them to kneel before him What a turn of events

              "2       US Secretary of State John F Kerry said Monday that he will stop in Paris later this week amid criticism that no top American officials attended Sunday s unity march against terrorism  Kerry said he expects to arrive in Paris Thursday evening as he heads home after a week abroad He said he will fly to France at the conclusion of a series of meetings scheduled for Thursday in Sofia Bulgaria He plans to meet the next day with Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius and President Francois Hollande then return to Washington  The visit by Kerry who has family and childhood ties to the country and speaks fluent French could address some of the criticism that the United States snubbed France in its darkest hour in many years  The French press on Monday was filled with questions about why neither President Obama nor Kerry attended Sunday s march as about 40 leaders of other nations did Obama was said to have stayed away because his own security needs can be taxing on a country and Kerry had prior commitments  Among roughly 40 leaders who did attend was Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu no stranger to intense security who marched beside Hollande through the city streets The highest ranking US officials attending the march were Jane Hartley the ambassador to France and Victoria Nuland the assistant secretary of state for European affairs Attorney General Eric H Holder Jr was in Paris for meetings with law enforcement officials but did not participate in the march  Kerry spent Sunday at a business summit hosted by India s prime minister Narendra Modi The United States is eager for India to relax stringent laws that function as barriers to foreign investment and hopes Modi s government will act to open the huge Indian market for more American businesses  In a news conference Kerry brushed aside criticism that the United States had not sent a more senior official to Paris as “quibbling a little bit” He noted that many staffers of the American Embassy in Paris attended the march including the ambassador He said he had wanted to be present at the march himself but could not because of his prior commitments in India  “But that is why I am going there on the way home to make it crystal clear how passionately we feel about the events that have taken place there” he said  “And I don t think the people of France have any doubts about America s understanding of what happened of our personal sense of loss and our deep commitment to the people of France in this moment of trauma”

needs to capture more than 50 percent of the vote statewide if he wants to be positioned to win all of the states 95 GOP delegates That would put him one step closer to avoiding a contested convention  Weve got to vote and you know Cruz is way way down in the polls Trump urged supporters  Meanwhile Sanders is hoping for a close race in the Empire State A loss by 10 points means hell need to win 80 percent of the remaining delegates to clinch the nomination  Despite a predicted loss in New York Cruz hasnt lost momentum Hes hoping to sweep up more delegates this weekend while hes talking about how he can win in November  Because if Im the nominee we win the General Election Cruz promised his supporters Were beating Hillary in the key swing states were beating Hillary with Independents were beating Hillary with young people  For now Cruz Kasich and Sanders have all moved on from New York to other states Trump and Clinton are the only two staying in their home state to watch the results

              "6330    The State Department told the Republican National Committee that it could not find any emails to or from Hillary Clintons former IT specialist who managed her private email server during her tenure as secretary of state before going on to work for the agency according to a court filing made public Monday    The governments revelation in US District Court in Washington came in answer to a lawsuit by the Republican National Committee The RNC had sued over its public records request for all workrelated emails sent to or received by Clintons former aide Bryan Pagliano between 2009 and 2013 the years of Clintons tenure as Americas top diplomat The lawsuit also pressed for other State Department records from the Clinton era  The RNCs filing said lawyers for the agency had informed them in discussions that the State Department has represented that no responsive records exist for any Pagliano emails Pagliano was hired at the agency after reportedly setting up Clintons server in 2009 but the lack of any official State Department emails raises the question whether he limited his email traffic using a private account much like Clinton did during her four years as secretary or whether his government emails were deleted    A State Department official said Monday that the agency possessed emails from Pagliano from the period after Clintons term had ended when he continued to work as a technology contractor  Agency spokeswoman Elizabeth Trudeau then added Monday evening that some Pagliano emails dating from Clintons tenure had been recovered from agency officials files and turned over to other organizations including Senate investigators    We have previously produced through FOIA and to Congress emails sent and received by Mr Pagliano during Secretary Clintons tenure Trudeau said in a public statement At least one email which was sent in November 2012 to Clinton from Pagliano  but possibly from his private email address  was released as part of 30000 Clinton emails made public by the agency over the past year    A spokesman for the RNC said the organization stood by its description of the discussions with lawyers for the State Department The group said in its filing that the State Department has represented that no responsive records exist    Raj Shah the RNC spokesman added Its hard to believe that an IT staffer who set up Hillary Clintons reckless email server never sent or received a single workrelated email in the four years he worked at the State Department Clintons campaign officials declined to comment in response to questions from The Associated Press    Trudeau said the State Department is working with Congress and several public records requesters to provide relevant material She also said agency officials continue to search for Mr Paglianos emails which the department may have otherwise retained Trudeau also said the department would respond further to the RNC in court    State Department officials told Senate investigators last year they could not find a file containing Paglianos work emails during Clintons tenure an assertion first reported by Politico    Fox News reported in March that Pagliano has revealed several details about Clintons personal email system to investigators including who had access to it as well as when and what devices were used An intelligence source close to the case told Fox News that Pagliano has been a devastating witness to Clinton  The one email sent by Pagliano that surfaced among Clintons 30000 emails was sent to Clinton was a November 2012 birthday greeting He wished her Happy Birthday Madam Secretary To many more    Paglianos email address was censored unlike numerous official State Department addresses that are listed in Clintons emails  suggesting he may have sent the message from a private address  Clinton did not reply directly to Pagliano Instead she sent a copy of an email to an aide with the instruction Pls respond

              "6331    The  P  in PBS Should Stand for  Plutocratic  or  Pentagon  Posted on Oct 27 2016  WikiMedia   In a television commercial that the Public Broadcasting System PBS ran for years “PBS NewsHour” host Gwen Ifill declared that she loved her job because it allowed her to “ask not only all of my questions but also and more importantly all of your questions ” This assertion was and remains absurd just like her network s regular fundraising claim to be free of corporate sponsors  The claim has long been contradicted by the string of corporateimage commercials purchased by leading financial defense auto insurance and rail corporations that appear before the network s nightly “NewsHour” broadcast along with a list of corporatesponsored foundations and superwealthy individuals who pay for the show along with “regular viewers like you”  Consistent with those commercials and despite its name the news and commentary one finds on PBS is in rich tune with the narrow capitalist parameters of acceptable coverage and debate that typify the more fully and explicitly forprofit and commercialized corporate media As progressive journalist David Sirota suggested two years ago  reflecting on recent investigations showing that supermoneyed rightwing capitalists such as the Koch brothers and Texas billionaire John Arnold had along with more liberal software mogul Bill Gates influenced PBS content through multimilliondollar donations the “P” in PBS often seems to more properly stand for “Plutocratic” not “Public”  Advertisement Square Site wide  None of this should be surprising to anyone familiar with the distinctively bigbusinessdominated history of US broadcast media  Because the United States fails to provide anything like adequate funding for public broadcasting both PBS and National Public Radio a regular vehicle for neoliberal business ideology depend upon foundations corporations and wealthy individuals to pay for much of their programming Beneath their standard claims to have no interest in shaping public media content these private funders have bottomline agendas meaning that their contributions come with strings attached strings that undermine the integrity of the “independent” journalism they bankroll For what it s worth between 1994 and 2014 the “NewsHour” was primarily owned by the forprofit firm Liberty Media  Liberty Media was run by the conservative and politically active billionaire John Malone who had a majority stake in MacNeilLehrer Productions the show s producer  The Pentagon Broadcasting System  What might seem more surprising perhaps is the remarkable extent to which the “P” in PBS often seems to stand for “Pentagon” or perhaps “Presidential” when it comes to foreign policy content Whatever the global issue of the day or week “NewsHour” anchors and their invited “experts” can be counted on to report and reflect in accord with the doctrinal assumption that Washington always operates with the best of intentions They almost uniformly treat the US as a great benevolent and indispensable force for freedom democracy security peace and order in a dangerous world full of evil and deadly actors  The show s invited commentators are drawn primarily from the nation s imperial establishment They are commonly current or retired insiders from within the Pentagon the White House the “intelligence community” andor the nation s elite network of foreign policy think tanks the Council on Foreign Relations the granddaddy of all US rulingclass think tanks  the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace the Aspen Institute the Atlantic Council the Rand Corp and the Hoover Institution to name a handful “NewsHour” anchors and guests generally agree that the United States  officially designated enemies are malevolent bad guys who need to be contained controlled and even attacked by the ultimate good guy Uncle Sam  Not surprisingly the long and ongoing record of US imperial arrogance and criminality more on that below is swept down George Orwell s memory hole even as new entries are added to the ugly registry When reported by the “NewsHour” horrific crimes committed by the US military are always treated as wellintended mistakes Along with the rest of the mainstream US media the “NewsHour” “insists that Russia deliberately bombs hospitals etc whereas if we do it it is of course an accident ”  There s some room for disagreement between and among the show s invited experts including the show s semiloopy foreign policy authority Margaret Warner about specific US foreign policy tactics strategies and actions There s no space for serious debate about the immorality lawlessness or imperial nature of that policy On the rare occasions “NewsHour” anchors seem to challenge guests from the White House or Pentagon on foreign policy matters it is generally to ask why the US isn t going harder at the officially certified bad guys  America as Umpire Not Empire  The foreign policy coverage and commentary doesn t get much better in the documentary division of PBS A recent documentary first aired nationally last week shown by PBS bears the risible title “American Umpire” an obvious World Series season play on what the filmmakers see as the preposterous notion of an American empire It is narrated by exMarine and former “NewsHour” host and producer Jim Lehrer Developed by the rightwing Hoover Institution and “targeted for PBS” the organization s own revealing phrase “American Umpire” takes the doctrinal “American exceptionalist” USgoodandcivilizedrestofworlddangerousandbad narrative to absurd lengths  It provides extensive “expert” commentary from such former imperial operatives as Madeline Albright the onetime US secretary of state who led the charge to criminally bomb Serbia and who went on CBS  “60 Minutes” to say that the death of more than half a million Iraqi children killed by Washingtonled “economic sanctions” was “a price worth paying” for the advance of US foreign policy goals Condoleezza Rice George W Bush s neoconservative national security adviser before and during the archcriminal US invasion of Iraq Gen Jim “Mad Dog” Mattis an Iraq invasion commander and a former chief of the US Central Command who two years ago told a San Diego audience that “it s fun to shoot people” George Schultz the Reaganera secretary of state who called the Sandinista government in Nicaragua “a cancer in our own land mass” that must be “cut out” and Karl Eikenberry a retired Army lieutenant general who commanded US forces in Afghanistan 10 years ago  With further commentary from a handful of mostly conservative academicians above all the nationalist Texas AM historian Elizabeth Cobbs  author of a book on which the documentary is based “American Umpire” portrays 20th and 21st century US foreign policy as nothing more than a noble effort to selflessly provide welcome and fair rules and discipline on the rest of a childish dangerous and reckless planet think “Lord of the Flies” that lacks the exceptional historical experience bequeathed to US leaders by the nation s farseeing Founding Fathers The only substantive criticism of US foreign policy in “American Umpire” is the complaint voiced by numerous interview subjects that America harms itself to the benefit of others the Europeans above all by taking upon its shoulders too much of the burden of benevolently policing the planet We are just too good for our own good  Our Real Task  There is not space here to discuss in responsible detail the epic historical deletions and distortions this narrative imposes The omissions are staggering They range from the slaughter of hundreds of thousands of Filipinos resisting US imperial invasion and occupation at the last century s outset to the restoration of de facto slavery in Haiti and the Dominican Republic after World War I the unnecessary atom bombing of Hiroshima and even worse of Nagasaki really the first shots of the Cold War  the toppling of more than 50 governments by US coups and invasions since the end of World War II the liquidation of perhaps as many as 5 million Southeast Asians in the socalled Vietnam War between 1962 and 1975 the Cold Warera sponsorship of Third World fascism from Chile to South Africa and Indonesia the attempted assassinations of Fidel Castro and numerous CIAdirected terror bombings in socialist Cuba the near instigation of global thermonuclear war on at least three occasions the development and sponsorship of Osama bin Laden and other radically archreactionary jihadist Muslim paramilitary forces to fight the Cold War against the Soviet Union in Afghanistan the “Highway of Death” when US warplanes engaged in an aerial traffic jam as they rushed to slaughter tens of thousands of surrendered Iraqi troops retreating from Iraq in 1991 the coordination and sponsorship of a massmurderous civil war on peasants workers and intellectuals with a death toll well into the many hundreds of thousands in Central America during the 1970s and 1980s the disastrous US invasion of Iraq responsible for at least 1 million Iraqi deaths the calamitous US toppling of the Libyan Gadhafi regime the calamitous destabilization of the Syrian regime the US funding and encouragement of civil war in central Africa the enablement and protection of a vicious rightwing coup in Honduras in the spring and summer of 2009 the criminal US global war of terror replete with rampant “targeted assassinations” torture illegal renditions endless drone war and specialforces killing operations across the Muslim world and other places as well  “American Umpire” hides these horrific transgressions and the imperial calculations behind much of US foreign policy past and present As numerous key US planning documents reveal over and over the goal of that policy was to maintain and if necessary install governments that “favored private investment of domestic and foreign capital production for export and the right to bring profits out of the country” Given the United States  remarkable possession of half the world s capital after World War II Washington elites had no doubt that US investors and corporations would profit the most Internally the basic selfish national and imperial objectives were openly and candidly discussed As the “liberal” and “dovish” imperialist top State Department planner and key Cold War architect George F Kennan explained in Policy Planning Study 23 a critical 1948 document “We have about 50 of the world s wealth but only 63 of its population … In this situation we cannot fail to be the object of envy and resentment Our real task in the coming period is to devise a pattern of relationships which will permit us to maintain this position of disparity … To do so we will have to dispense with all sentimentality and daydreaming  The less we are then hampered by idealistic slogans the better”  The necessity of dispensing with “human rights” and other “sentimental” and “unreal objectives” was especially pressing in the “global south” Washington assigned the vast periphery of the world economic capitalist system Africa Latin America Southeast Asia and the energyrich and thus strategically hypersignificant Middle East a less than flattering role It was to “fulfill its major function as a source of raw materials and a market”  actual State Department language  for the great industrial capitalist nations excluding “socialist” Russia and its satellites It was to be exploited both for the benefit of US corporationsinvestors and for the reconstruction of Europe and Japan as prosperous US trading and investment partners organized on properly capitalist principles that were hostile to the Soviet bloc  “Democracy” was fine as a slogan and benevolent idealisticsounding mission statement when it came to marketing this core underlying ultraimperialist US policy at home and abroad Because most people in the “Third World” had no interest in neocolonial subordination and subscribed to what US intelligence officials considered the heretical “idea that government has direct responsibility for the welfare of its people” what postWorld War II US planners called “communism” Washington s reallife commitment to popular governance abroad was strictly qualified to say the least “Democracy” was suitable to the US as long as its outcomes comported with the interests of US investorscorporations and related US geopolitical objectives It had to be abandoned undermined andor crushed when it threatened those investorscorporations and the broader imperatives of business rule to any significant degree As President Richard Nixon s coldblooded National Security Adviser Henry Kissinger explained in June 1970 three years before the US sponsored a fascist coup that overthrew Chile s democratically elected leftist President Salvador Allende “I don t see why we need to stand by and watch a country go Communist because of the irresponsibility of its own people”  The selfish imperial cynicism of US foreign policy continues to this day into the postCold War and post911 era As leading Dutch political scientists Bastiaann van Apeldoorn and Nana de Graaff write in their important new volume  “American Grand Strategy and Corporate Elite Networks The Open Door Since the End of the Cold War” “From the end of the 19th nineteenth century onward American grand strategy has pursued a liberal expansionism aimed at the creation of a global hegemony premised upon open “free” markets to which global capital and above all US transnational capital has full access … The global Open Door has continued to define the ends of the American grand strategy throughout the postCold War era” Because as during and before the Cold War s end Washington s commitment to “democracy” and “human rights” is conditional and hypocritical The noble principles are fine insofar as they serve the freemarket hegemony of global and especially US transnational capital They are dispensed with even as US policymakers trumpet them when they do not\n",
              "6332     AntiTrump Protesters Are Tools of the Oligarchy Reform always provokes rage on the part of those who profit by the old order Arthur M Schlesinger Jr The Crisis of the Old Order By Paul Craig Roberts  Who are the antiTrump protesters besmirching the name of progressives by pretending to be progressives and by refusing to accept the outcome of the presidential election They look like and are acting worse than the white trash that they are denouncing I think I know who they are They are thugs for hire and are paid by the Oligarchy to delegitimize Trumps presidency in the way that Washington and the German Marshall Fund paid students in Kiev to protest the democratically elected Ukrainian government in order to prepare the way for a coup The organization changeorg which claims to be a progressive group but might be a front along with other progressive groups for the Oligarchy is destroying the reputation of all progressives by circulating a petition that directs the electors of the Electoral Collage to annul the election by casting their votes for Hillary Remember how upset progressives were when Trump said he might not accept the election result if there was evidence that the vote was rigged Now progressives are doing what they damned Trump for saying he might do under certain conditions The Western presstitutes used the protests in Kiev to delegitimize a democratically elected government and to set it up for a coup The protest pay was good enough that nonUkrainians came from nearby countries to participate in the protest in order to collect the money At the time I posted the amounts paid daily to protesters Reports came in to me from Eastern and Western Europe from people who were not Ukrainian but were paid to protest as if they were Ukrainians The same thing is going on with the Trump protests CNN reports that for many Americans across the country Donald Trumps victory is an outcome they simply refuse to accept Tens of thousands filled the streets in at least 25 US cities overnight This is the exact reporting that the Oligarchy desired from its presstitutes and got I hope no one thinks that simultaneous protests in 25 cities were a spontaneous event How did 25 independent protests manage to come up with the same slogans and the same signs on the same night following the election What is the point of the protests and what interest is served by them As the Romans always asked who benefits There is only one answer The Oligarchy and only the Oligarchy benefits Trump is a threat to the Oligarchy because he intends to stop the giveaway of American jobs to foreigners The jobs giveaway sanctified by the neoliberal junk economists as free trade is one of the main reasons for the 21st century worsening of the US income distribution Money that was formerly paid in middle class wages and salaries to American manufacturing employees and college graduates has been rerouted to the pockets of the One Percent When US corporations move their production of goods and services sold to Americans offshore to Asian countries such as China and India their wage bill falls The money formerly paid in middle class incomes goes instead into executive bonuses and dividends and capital gains to shareholders The ladders of upward mobility that had made America the land of opportunity were dismantled for the sole purpose of making a handful of people multibillionaires Trump is a threat to the Oligarchy because he intends peaceful relations with Russia In order to replace the profitable Soviet Threat the Oligarchy and their neoconservative agents worked overtime to recreate the Russian Threat by demonizing Russia Accustomed to many decades of excess profits from the profitable Cold War the militarysecurity complex was angry when President Reagan brought the Cold War to an end Before these leaches on American taxpayers could get the Cold War going again the Soviet Union collapsed as a result of a rightwing coup against Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev The militarysecurity complex and their zionist neoconservative agents cooked up the war on terror to keep the money flowing to the One Percent But as hard as the presstitute media worked to create fear of the Muslim threat even insouciant Americans knew that the Muslims did not have thousands of ICBMs carrying powerful thermonuclear weapons capable of destroying the entirety of the United States in a few minutes Neither did the Muslims have the Red Army capable of overrunning all of Europe in a couple of days Indeed the Muslims havent needed an army Refugees from Washingtons wars enabled by Europeans are overrunning Europe The excuse for the annual trillion dollar $1000 billion  militarysecurity budget was missing So the Oligarchy created the New Hitler in Russia Hillary was the Oligarchys principle agent for heating up the new Cold War Hillary is the tool enriched by the Oligarchy whose job as President was to protect and to increase the trillion dollar budget of the militarysecurity complex With Hillary in the White House the looting of the American taxpayers in behalf of the wealth of the One Percent could go forward unimpeded But if Trump resolves the Russian threat the Oligarchy takes an income hit Hillarys job as President was also to privatize Social Security in order that her Wall Street benefactors can rip off Americans the way that Americans have been ripped off by the insurance companies under Obamacare Those Americans who do not pay attention think mistakenly that the FBI cleared Hillary of violating National Security protocols with her email practices The FBI said that Hillary did violate National Security but that it was a result of carelessness or ignorance She got off from indictment because the FBI concluded that she did not intentionally violate National Security protocols The investigation of the Clinton Foundation continues In other words in order to protect Hillary the FBI fell back on the ancient common law rule that there can be no crime without intent See PCR and Lawrence Stratton The Tyranny of Good Intentions  One would think that protesters if they were legitimate would be celebrating Trumps victory He unlike Hillary promises to reduce tensions with powerful Russia and we hope also with China Unlike Hillary Trump says he is concerned with the absence of careers for those very people protesting in the streets of 25 cities against him In other words the protests against the American people for electing Trump as their president are pointless The protests are happening for one reason only The Oligarchy intends to delegitimize the Trump Presidency Once President Trump is delegitimized it will be easier for the Oligarchy to assassinate him Unless the Oligarchy can appoint and control Trumps government Trump is a prime candidate for assassination The protests against Trump are suspicious for another reason Unlike Hillary Obama and George W Bush Donald Trump has not slaughtered and dislocated millions of peoples in seven countries sending millions of refugees from the Oligarchys wars to overrun Europe Trump earned his fortune and if by hook or crook not by selling US government influence to foreign agents as Bill and Hillary did So what are the protesters protesting There is no answer except that they are hired to protest Just as the Maidan protesters in Kiev were hired to protest by US and German financed NGOs The protests in Kiev were equally pointless because presidential elections were only months away If Ukrainians really believed that their president was conspiring with Russia to keep Ukraine from becoming a Western puppet state and wished to become a puppet state regardless of the costs the opportunity to vote the government out was at hand The only reason for the protests was to orchestrate a coup The US did succeed in putting their agent in control of the new Ukrainian government as Victoria Nuland and the US ambassador in Kiev confirmed in their telephone conversation that is available on the Internet The Maidan protests were pointless except for making a coup possible The protests were without any doubt arranged by Washington through Assistant Secretary of State Victoria Nuland a neoconservative brought into the State Department by Hillary Clinton for the purpose of creating conflict with Russia Trump is being protested in order to make him vulnerable in the event he proves to be the threat to the Oligarchy that he is thought to be Trump won the presidency but the Oligarchy is still in power which makes any real reforms difficult to achieve Symbolic reforms can be the product of the contest between President Trump and the oligarchs Karl Marx learned from historical experience and Lenin Stalin and Pol Pot learned from Karl Marx that change cannot occur if the displaced ruling class is left intact after a revolution against them We have proof of this throughout South America Every revolution by the indigenous people has left unmolested the Spanish ruling class and every revolution has been overthrown by collusion between the ruling class and Washington Washington has conspired with traditional elites to remove the elected presidents of Honduras on a number of occasions Recently Washington helped elites evict the female presidents of Argentina and Brazil The presidents of Venezuela Ecuador and Bolivia are in the crosshairs and are unlikely to survive Washington is determined to get its hands on Julian Assange To achieve this Washington intends to overthrow the Ecuadoran government that in defiance of Washington gave Julian Assange political asylum Hugo Chavez had the power to exile or to exterminate the Spanish ruling class in Venezuela when the ruling class participated in a CIA coup against Chavez But before the CIA could kill Chavez the people and the military forced his release Instead of punishing the criminals who would have murdered him Chavez let them go According to Marx Lenin and Stalin this is the classic mistake of the revolutionary To rely on good will from the overthrown ruling class is the certain road to the defeat of the revolution Latin American has proved itself unable to learn this lesson Revolutions cannot be conciliatory Trump is a dealmaker The Oligarchy can permit him the sheen of success in exchange for no real change Trump is not perfect He might fail on his own But we should back him on the two most important elements in his program to reduce tensions between the major nuclear powers and to halt Washingtons policy of permitting globalism to destroy Americans economic prospects If tensions between nuclear powers worsen we wont be here to worry about other problems The combination of the economy hollowed out by globalism and immigration is an economic nightmare That Trump understands this is reason to support him Note Some believe that Trump is a ruse conducted by the Oligarchy However as Hillary is the boughtandpaidfor representative of the Oligarchy such an elaborate ruse is unnecessary It is preferable for the Oligarchy to win on its own platform than to install a president on the opposite platform and then change him around Another sellout increases the anger of the people If Hillary had won the Oligarchy would have had the

              "6333    ADDIS ABABA Ethiopia  President Obama convened a meeting with the leaders of several East African nations and the African Union on Monday in an effort to address the worsening situation in South Sudan even as he met with Ethiopia s prime minister to discuss how to strengthen human rights and democratic institutions here  With no resolution in sight for the ongoing conflict in South Sudan Obama brought together top officials from Ethiopia Uganda Kenya Sudan and the AU to chart out a strategy in the event that the latest round of peace talks fail  African nations led by Ethiopia have been trying to broker a peace in South Sudan through the Intergovernmental Authority on Development IGAD a regional body and are almost ready to present a possible compromise to the warring parties The two sides will have until Aug 17 to respond to the proposal but administration officials have little expectation that they will accept it  On Monday Obama praised the regional leaders for showing “extraordinary leadership in trying to address the continuing situation in South Sudan” The group included Ethiopian Prime Minister Hailemariam Desalegn Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta African Union Chairperson Dlamini Zuma and Sudan s minister of foreign affairs Ibrahim Ghandour  “This gives me and the US delegation an opportunity to learn from them what progress has been made where there appears to be continued roadblocks and how we can partner with them to make progress” Obama said “Our hope is that we can actually bring about the kind of peace that the people of South Sudan so desperately need”  The question of South Sudan   a nation that the United States helped bring into existence in 2011 after years of effort by both the George W Bush and Obama administrations   has vexed American policymakers for years  In December 2013 South Sudan President Salva Kiir accused Riek Machar who had served as his vice president of attempting a coup d etat The two had been longtime political rivals from different ethnic groups   Kiir is Dinka Machar is a Nuer   who had come together to form a government when the country was first created  While tribal differences have helped fuel the conflict the war has been largely focused on control of the nation s oil fields South Sudan s primary source of revenue  Princeton Lyman US special envoy for Sudan and South Sudan from 2011 to 2013 noted that when he first took over as envoy the United States had spent $10 billion on peacekeeping and other assistance for the two nations “and that was four years ago… This is a big investment” he added  At this point more than 25 million people are facing food shortages while roughly 15 million are displaced from their homes An additional 520000 South Sudanese have fled across the border into neighboring countries including Ethiopia  The conflict also poses a major economic problem for Kenya which had major investments in South Sudan before the fighting broke out The LAPSSET Corridor project was aimed at transporting oil from South Sudan to the Kenyan port of Lamu and according to EJ Hogendoorn deputy program director for Africa at the International Crisis Group the planned transportation and infrastructure development could have been an “engine of development for many parts of East Africa Unfortunately of course that s on hold because of the war” he said  While Obama spent part of the afternoon addressing a regional conflict in Africa he devoted the rest of the day to strengthening ties with Ethiopia whose alliance with the United States dates back more than a century But the current government has come under sharp criticism for its treatment of political opponents and journalists  Obama is the first sitting US president to visit Ethiopia  In a news conference Monday afternoon both Obama and Hailemariam said they had a frank discussion about Ethiopias human rights practices and the need for improvement Ethiopia is Africa s number two jailer of journalists according to the Committee to Protect Journalists and its ruling party won 100 percent of the seats in May s parliamentary elections  White House national security adviser Susan Rice asked last week whether she considered Ethiopia a democracy replied with irony “One hundred percent”  But during the news conference Obama twice referred to the Ethiopian government as “democratically elected”  “I don t bite my tongue” Obama said of raising concerns on these issues with Ethiopia “But I do so from a position of respect”  Hailemariam for his part said “Our commitment to democracy is real not skin deep”  But he added later that people could not expect sweeping reforms given the fact that military rule ended just a couple of decades ago “Something has to be understood This is a fledgling democracy”  The two leaders also discussed their collaboration on counterterrorism an area in which Ethiopia has been an active leader The White House announced Monday it will “work with Congress to provide approximately $465 million” this year in new training equipment and capacitybuilding aid to its African allies  The administration also said it would provide at least $40 million in assistance this fiscal year to combat violent extremism in East Africa The money is intended to foster collaboration among security forces law enforcement government officials community leaders and members of civil society officials said  Obama praised Ethiopia s work to curb extremist activity but noted that its government had labeled some opposition groups as posing a greater threat than US intelligence would indicate “Our intelligence indicates while they may oppose the government they have not tipped into terrorism” he said  The United States provides more than $600 million in assistance to Ethiopia annually The vast bulk of that   $490 million   comes from the US Agency for International Development while the rest is largely securityrelated Last fiscal year nearly $200 million went to health programs while $163 million went to humanitarian aid  Obama said Ethiopia “has proven itself a global leader” on development and over the past 15 years “has lifted millions of people out of poverty”  “To many people around the world their image of Ethiopia remains stuck in the past remembering drought and famine” he said  The two leaders appeared to have a friendly rapport throughout the news conference Hailemariam described his country as scoring a series of firsts Along with being “the cradle of mankind” he said “Ethiopia is the birthplace of coffee” That elicited a smile from Obama  Obama said he was impressed by the Ethiopian s unusual pets “I had a chance to see the famous lions that live on the grounds he said I m considering getting some for the White House” But he conceded that before he did that “I ll have to make sure my dogs are safe”

              "6334    Jeb Bush Is Suddenly Attacking Trump Heres Why That Matters  Jeb Bush isnt pulling punches anymore when it comes to Donald Trump  The former Florida governor has delicately danced around the billionaire businessman in the 2016 presidential primary so far But the gloves came off this week when Bush called out Trump as a closet Democrat He was trying to stunt Trumps rise while attempting to recover his own political mojo  What Jeb is desperately trying to do is find his swagger right now GOP strategist Ford OConnell said The knock against Jeb is that hes low voltage and not willing to fight The best way to shake those perceptions it to engage against the person who is in the media on a 247 loop  Its a change from Bushs approach to this point He hasnt lobbed many direct attacks at Trump other than delicately condemning his criticism of Arizona Sen John McCains war service and his attacks against Fox News Megyn Kelly  Even in this months first debate Bush swatted down a story that he had allegedly called Trump a buffoon and a clown saying only that Trumps language had been divisive Trump called Bush a true gentleman  The detente ended this week So far most of the toptier candidates have avoided directly attacking Trump treating him with kid gloves so as not to anger the part of the GOP base to which Trump appeals  In other words the very voters they need when they hope Trump fades  In splitscreen New Hampshire town halls this week Bush and Trump volleyed attacks on each other Bush took his most pointed jabs at the current frontrunner underscoring Trumps past history as a Democrat and the liberal positions he used to hold  Mr Trump doesnt have a proven conservative record Bush said according to the Washington Post He was a Democrat longer in the last decade than he was a Republican He has given more money to Democrats than hes given to Republicans  Bush went on to attack Trump over his hardline immigration proposal arguing it was not just vitriolic but would have a massive price tag  Hundreds of billions of dollars of costs to implement his plans is not a conservative plan Bush said This is going to be my pitch Lets support someone who you dont have to guess where he stands because hes consistent because hes been governor hes consistently had the views that he has  Over the next few days Bush continued the hits on social media  But Trump never one to miss a moment to retaliate didnt pull his punches either At his own town hall Wednesday Trump blasted Bush as an unelectable lowenergy person  You know whats happening to Jebs crowd just down the street Theyre sleeping Trump said to applause  Since then Trump has also ramped up his attacks against Bush on Twitter  The move to more hot rhetoric may have tripped Bush up though Consider his use of the phrase anchor babies While immigration reform is something Bush is passionate about   and has even written a book about   hes often criticized within the GOP as too liberal on the issue Instead a more combative Bush appeared to use the loaded phrase for the first time  He was left struggling to defend his use of it It may have been a signal that the attackdog crouch hes taking is still one that isnt completely comfortable to Bush who earlier said he wanted to campaign joyfully  Other candidates have embraced hitting Trump Kentucky Sen Rand Paul went after him forcefully in the debate though his punch   that Trump was hedging his bets to support Hillary Clinton if she wins the presidency   didnt appear to land  Other candidates like Ohio Gov John Kasich demurred In the earlier GOP debate that night former Texas Gov Rick Perry and businesswoman Carly Fiorina also jabbed at Trump  Bush though needs to close the floodgates Hes dropped in national polls as Trump has risen And in New Hampshire where Bush once led Trump and even newcomer Kasich have seen surges  Cullen a former New Hampshire GOP chairman said the change in tone and tactics was a smart move for Bush one that could help him in the Granite State  I think its good politics for Jeb said Fergus Cullen a former New Hampshire Republican Party chairman Theres 25 percent of the Republicans who are entertained by Donald Trump But theres 60 percent of the party who say they wont vote for him under any circumstances Those arent Jeb Bushs people to begin with Hes trying to appeal to the other 60 percent by being the adult in the room and trying to govern  OConnell agreed He pointed out that even if this new approach is one thats uncomfortable for Bush its necessary  In a lot of elections being the studious one would have worked he said but Trump has flipped the script

            "|FAKE |FAKE      |Daniel Greenfield a Shillman Journalism Fellow at the Freedom Center is a New York writer focusing on radical Islam  In the final stretch of the election Hillary Rodham Clinton has gone to war with the FBI  The word “unprecedented” has been thrown around so often this election that it ought to be retired But it s still unprecedented for the nominee of a major political party to go war with the FBI  But that s exactly what Hillary and her people have done Coma patients just waking up now and watching an hour of CNN from their hospital beds would assume that FBI Director James Comey is Hillary s opponent in this election  The FBI is under attack by everyone from Obama to CNN Hillary s people have circulated a letter attacking Comey There are currently more media hit pieces lambasting him than targeting Trump It wouldn t be too surprising if the Clintons or their allies were to start running attack ads against the FBI  The FBI s leadership is being warned that the entire leftwing establishment will form a lynch mob if they continue going after Hillary And the FBI s credibility is being attacked by the media and the Democrats to preemptively head off the results of the investigation of the Clinton Foundation and Hillary Clinton  The covert struggle between FBI agents and Obama s DOJ people has gone explosively public  The New York Times has compared Comey to J Edgar Hoover Its bizarre headline “James Comey Role Recalls Hoover s FBI Fairly or Not” practically admits up front that it s spouting nonsense The Boston Globe has published a column calling for Comey s resignation Not to be outdone Time has an editorial claiming that the scandal is really an attack on all women  James Carville appeared on MSNBC to remind everyone that he was still alive and insane He accused Comey of coordinating with House Republicans and the KGB And you thought the “vast right wing conspiracy” was a stretch  Countless media stories charge Comey with violating procedure Do you know what s a procedural violation Emailing classified information stored on your bathroom server  Senator Harry Reid has sent Comey a letter accusing him of violating the Hatch Act The Hatch Act is a nice idea that has as much relevance in the age of Obama as the Tenth Amendment But the cable news spectrum quickly filled with media hacks glancing at the Wikipedia article on the Hatch Act under the table while accusing the FBI director of one of the most awkward conspiracies against Hillary ever  If James Comey is really out to hurt Hillary he picked one hell of a strange way to do it  Not too long ago Democrats were breathing a sigh of relief when he gave Hillary Clinton a pass in a prominent public statement If he really were out to elect Trump by keeping the email scandal going why did he trash the investigation Was he on the payroll of House Republicans and the KGB back then and playing it coy or was it a sudden development where Vladimir Putin and Paul Ryan talked him into taking a look at Anthony Weiner s computer  Either Comey is the most cunning FBI director that ever lived or he s just awkwardly trying to navigate a political mess that has trapped him between a DOJ leadership whose political futures are tied to Hillary s victory and his own bureau whose apolitical agents just want to be allowed to do their jobs  The only truly mysterious thing is why Hillary and her associates decided to go to war with a respected Federal agency Most Americans like the FBI while Hillary Clinton enjoys a 60 unfavorable rating  And it s an interesting question  Hillary s old strategy was to lie and deny that the FBI even had a criminal investigation underway Instead her associates insisted that it was a security review The FBI corrected her and she shrugged it off But the old breezy denial approach has given way to a savage assault on the FBI  Pretending that nothing was wrong was a bad strategy but it was a better one that picking a fight with the FBI while lunatic Clinton associates try to claim that the FBI is really the KGB  There are two possible explanations  Hillary Clinton might be arrogant enough to lash out at the FBI now that she believes that victory is near The same kind of hubris that led her to plan her victory fireworks display could lead her to declare a war on the FBI for irritating her during the final miles of her campaign  But the other explanation is that her people panicked  Going to war with the FBI is not the behavior of a smart and focused presidential campaign It s an act of desperation When a presidential candidate decides that her only option is to try and destroy the credibility of the FBI that s not hubris it s fear of what the FBI might be about to reveal about her  During the original FBI investigation Hillary Clinton was confident that she could ride it out And she had good reason for believing that But that Hillary Clinton is gone In her place is a paranoid wreck Within a short space of time the “positive” Clinton campaign promising to unite the country has been replaced by a desperate and flailing operation that has focused all its energy on fighting the FBI  There s only one reason for such bizarre behavior  The Clinton campaign has decided that an FBI investigation of the latest batch of emails poses a threat to its survival And so it s gone all in on fighting the FBI It s an unprecedented step born of fear It s hard to know whether that fear is justified But the existence of that fear already tells us a whole lot  Clinton loyalists rigged the old investigation They knew the outcome ahead of time as well as they knew the debate questions Now suddenly they are no longer in control And they are afraid  You can smell the fear  The FBI has wiretaps from the investigation of the Clinton Foundation It s finding new emails all the time And Clintonworld panicked The spinmeisters of Clintonworld have claimed that the email scandal is just so much smoke without fire All that s here is the appearance of impropriety without any of the substance But this isn t how you react to smoke It s how you respond to a fire  The misguided assault on the FBI tells us that Hillary Clinton and her allies are afraid of a revelation bigger than the fundamental illegality of her email setup The email setup was a preemptive cover up The Clinton campaign has panicked badly out of the belief right or wrong that whatever crime the illegal setup was meant to cover up is at risk of being exposed  The Clintons have weathered countless scandals over the years Whatever they are protecting this time around is bigger than the usual corruption bribery sexual assaults and abuses of power that have followed them around throughout the years This is bigger and more damaging than any of the allegations that have already come out And they don t want FBI investigators anywhere near it  The campaign against Comey is pure intimidation It s also a warning Any senior FBI people who value their careers are being warned to stay away The Democrats are closing ranks around their nominee against the FBI It s an ugly and unprecedented scene It may also be their last stand  Hillary Clinton has awkwardly wound her way through numerous scandals in just this election cycle But she s never shown fear or desperation before Now that has changed Whatever she is afraid of it lies buried in her emails with Huma Abedin And it can bring her down like nothing else has

            "|FAKE |FAKE      |Google Pinterest Digg Linkedin Reddit Stumbleupon Print Delicious Pocket Tumblr  There are two fundamental truths in this world Paul Ryan desperately wants to be president And Paul Ryan will never be president Today proved it  In a particularly staggering example of political cowardice Paul Ryan rererereversed course and announced that he was back on the Trump Train after all This was an aboutface from where he was a few weeks ago He had previously declared he would not be supporting or defending Trump after a tape was made public in which Trump bragged about assaulting women Suddenly Ryan was appearing at a proTrump rally and boldly declaring that he already sent in his vote to make him President of the United States It was a surreal moment The figurehead of the Republican Party dosed himself in gasoline got up on a stage on a chilly afternoon in Wisconsin and lit a match  SpeakerRyan says he voted for realDonaldTrump  “Republicans it is time to come home” httpstcoVyTT49YvoE pictwittercomwCvSCg4a5I    ABC News Politics ABCPolitics November 5 2016  The Democratic Party couldn t have asked for a better moment of film Ryan s chances of ever becoming president went down to zero in an instant In the wreckage Trump is to leave behind in his wake those who cravenly backed his campaign will not recover If Ryan s career manages to limp all the way to 2020 then the DNC will have this tape locked and loaded to be used in every ad until Election Day  The ringing endorsement of the man he clearly hates on a personal level speaks volumes about his own spinelessness Ryan has postured himself as a “principled” conservative and one uncomfortable with Trump s unapologetic bigotry and sexism However when push came to shove Paul Ryan  like many of his colleagues  turned into a sniveling appeaser After all his lofty tak about conviction his principles were a house of cards and collapsed with the slightest breeze  What s especially bizarre is how close Ryan came to making it through unscathed For months the Speaker of the House refused to comment on Trump at all His strategy seemed to be to keep his head down pretend Trump didn t exist and hope that nobody remembered what happened in 2016 Now just days away from the election he screwed it all up  If 2016 s very ugly election has done any good it s by exposing the utter cowardice of the Republicans who once feigned moral courage A reality television star spit on them hijacked their party insulted their wives and got every last one of them to kneel before him What a

            "|REAL |REAL      |US Secretary of State John F Kerry said Monday that he will stop in Paris later this week amid criticism that no top American officials attended Sunday s unity march against terrorism  Kerry said he expects to arrive in Paris Thursday evening as he heads home after a week abroad He said he will fly to France at the conclusion of a series of meetings scheduled for Thursday in Sofia Bulgaria He plans to meet the next day with Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius and President Francois Hollande then return to Washington  The visit by Kerry who has family and childhood ties to the country and speaks fluent French could address some of the criticism that the United States snubbed France in its darkest hour in many years  The French press on Monday was filled with questions about why neither President Obama nor Kerry attended Sunday s march as about 40 leaders of other nations did Obama was said to have stayed away because his own security needs can be taxing on a country and Kerry had prior commitments  Among roughly 40 leaders who did attend was Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu no stranger to intense security who marched beside Hollande through the city streets The highest ranking US officials attending the march were Jane Hartley the ambassador to France and Victoria Nuland the assistant secretary of state for European affairs Attorney General Eric H Holder Jr was in Paris for meetings with law enforcement officials but did not participate in the march  Kerry spent Sunday at a business summit hosted by India s prime minister Narendra Modi The United States is eager for India to relax stringent laws that function as barriers to foreign investment and hopes Modi s government will act to open the huge Indian market for more American businesses  In a news conference Kerry brushed aside criticism that the United States had not sent a more senior official to Paris as “quibbling a little bit” He noted that many staffers of the American Embassy in Paris attended the march including the ambassador He said he had wanted to be present at the march himself but could not because of his prior commitments in India  “But that is why I am going there on the way home to make it crystal clear how passionately we feel about the events that have taken place there” he said  “And I don t think the people of France have any doubts about America s understanding of what happened of our personal sense of loss and our deep commitment to the people of France in this moment of trauma”

            "|REAL |REAL      |Its primary day in New York and frontrunners Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump are leading in the polls  Trump is now vowing to win enough delegates to clinch the Republican nomination and prevent a contested convention But SensTed Cruz RTexas Bernie Sanders DVt and Ohio Gov John Kasich and arent giving up just yet  A big win in New York could tip the scales for both the Republican and Democratic frontrunners in this years race for the White House Clinton and Trump have each suffered losses in recent contests shifting the momentum to their rivals  We have won eight out of the last nine caucuses and primaries Cheer Sanders recently told supporters  While wins in New York for Trump and Clinton are expected the margins of those victories are also important  Trump needs to capture more than 50 percent of the vote statewide if he wants to be positioned to win all of the states 95 GOP delegates That would put him one step closer to avoiding a contested convention  Weve got to vote and you know Cruz is way way down in the polls Trump urged supporters  Meanwhile Sanders is hoping for a close race in the Empire State A loss by 10 points means hell need to win 80 percent of the remaining delegates to clinch the nomination  Despite a predicted loss in New York Cruz hasnt lost momentum Hes hoping to sweep up more delegates this weekend while hes talking about how he can win in November  Because if Im the nominee we win the General Election Cruz promised his supporters Were beating Hillary in the key swing states were beating Hillary with Independents were beating Hillary with young people  For now Cruz Kasich and Sanders have all moved on from New York to other states Trump and Clinton are the only two staying in their home state to watch the results come in

            "|FAKE |FAKE      |   I m not an immigrant but my grandparents are More than 50 years ago they arrived in New York City from Iran I grew up mainly in central New Jersey an American kid playing little league for the Raritan Red Sox and soccer for the Raritan Rovers In 1985 I travelled with my family to our ancestral land I was only eight but old enough to understand that the Iranians had lost their liberty and freedom I saw the abject despair of a people who in a desperate attempt to bring about change had ushered in nationalist tyrants led by Ayatollah Khomeini  What I witnessed during that year in Iran changed the course of my life In 1996 at age 19 wanting to help preserve the blessings of liberty and freedom we enjoy in America I enlisted in the US Navy Now with the rise of Donald Trump and his nationalist altright movement I ve come to feel that the values I sought to protect are in jeopardy  In Iran theocratic fundmentalists sowed division and hatred of outsiders   of Westerners Christians and other religious minorities Here in America the right wing seems to have stolen passages directly from their playbook as it spreads hatred of immigrants particularly Muslim ones This form of nationalistic bigotry   Islamophobia   threatens the heart of our nation When I chose to serve in the military I did so to protect what I viewed as our sacred foundational values of liberty equality and democracy Now 20 years later I ve joined forces with fellow veterans to again fight for those sacred values this time right here at home  “Death to America”  As a child I sat in my class at the international school one sunny morning and heard in the distance the faint sounds of gunfire and rising chants of “Death to America” That day would define the rest of my life  It was Tehran the capital of Iran in 1985 I was attending a unique school for bilingual students who had been born in Western nations It had become the last refuge in that city with any tolerance for Western teaching but that also made it a target for military fundamentalists As the gunfire drew closer I heard boots pounding the marble tiles outside marching into our building and thundering down the corridor toward my classroom As I heard voices chanting “Death to America” I remember wondering if I would survive to see my parents again  In a flash of green and black uniforms those soldiers rushed into our classroom grabbed us by our shirt collars and yelled at us to get outside We were then packed into the school s courtyard where a soldier pointed his rifle at our group and commanded us to look up Almost in unison my classmates and I raised our eyes and saw the flags of our many nations being torn down and dangled from the balcony then set ablaze and tossed still burning into the courtyard As those flags floated to the ground in flames the soldiers fired their guns in the air Shouting they ordered us   if we ever wanted to see our families again   to swear allegiance to the Grand Ayatollah Khomeini and trample on the remains of the burning symbols of our home countries I scanned the smoke that was filling the courtyard for my friends and classmates and horrified watched them capitulate and begin to chant “Death to America” as they stomped on our sacred symbols  I was so angry that young as I was I began to plead with them to come to their senses No one paid the slightest attention to an eight year old and yet for the first time in my life I felt something like righteous indignation I suspect that born and raised in America I was already imbued with such a sense of privilege that I just couldn t fathom the immense danger I was in Certainly I was acting in ways no native Iranian would have found reasonable  Across the smokefilled courtyard I saw a soldier coming at me and knew he meant to force me to submit I spotted an American flag still burning dropped to my knees and grabbed the charred pieces from underneath a classmate s feet As the soldier closed in on me I ducked and ran still clutching my charred pieces of flag into a crowd of civilians who had gathered to witness the commotion The events of that day would come to define all that I have ever stood for   or against  “Camel Jockey” “Ayatollah” and “Gandhi”  My parents and I soon returned to the United States and I entered third grade More than anything I just wanted to be normal to fit in and be accepted by my peers Unfortunately my first name Nader which I changed to Nate upon joining the Navy and my swarthy Middle Eastern appearance were little help on that score eliciting regular jibes from my classmates Even at that young age they had already mastered a veritable thesaurus of ethnic defamation including “camel jockey” “sandnigger” “raghead” “ayatollah” and ironically “Gandhi” which I now take as a compliment My classmates regularly sought to “otherize” me in those years as if I were a lesser American because of my faith and ethnicity  Yet I remember that tingling in my chest when I first donned my Cub Scout uniform   all because of the American flag patch on its shoulder Something felt so good about wearing it a feeling I still had when I joined the military It seems that the flag I tried to rescue in Tehran was stapled to my heart or that s how I felt anyway as I wore my country s uniform  When I took my oath of enlistment in the US Navy I gave my mom a camera and asked her to take some photos but she was so overwhelmed with pride and joy that she cried throughout the ceremony and managed to snap only a few images of the carpet She cried even harder when I was selected to serve as the first MuslimAmerican member of the US Navy Presidential Ceremonial Honor Guard  On that day I was proud too and all the taunts of those bullies of my childhood seemed finally silenced  Being tormented because of my ethnicity and religion in those early years had another effect on me It caused me to become unusually sensitive to the nature of other people Somehow I grasped that if it weren t for a fear of the unknown there was an inherent goodness and frail humanity lurking in many of the kids who bullied and harassed me Often I discovered those same bullies could be tremendously kind to their families friends or even strangers I realized then that if despite everything I could lay myself bare and trust them enough to reach out in kindness I might in turn gain their trust and they might then see me too and stop operating from such a place of fear and hate  Through patience humor and understanding I was able to offer myself as the embodiment of my people and somehow defang the “otherness” of so much that Americans found scary To this day I have friends from elementary school middle school high school and the military who tell me that I am the only Muslim they have ever known and that had they not met me their perspective on Islam would have been wholly subject to the prevailing fearbased narrative that has poisoned this country since September 11 2001  In 1998 I became special assistant to the Master Chief Petty Officer of the Navy and then in 1999 I was recruited to serve at the Defense Intelligence Agency In August 2000 I transferred to the Naval Reserve  In the wake of 911 I began to observe how so many of my fellow Americans were adopting a fundamentalist “us vs them” attitude towards Muslims and Islam I suddenly found myself in an America where the scattered insults I had endured as a child took on an overarching and sinister meaning and form where they became something like an ideology and way of life  By the time I completed my military service in 2006 I had begun to understand that our policies in the Middle Eastsimilarly disturbed seemed in pursuit of little more than perpetual warfare That in turn was made possible by the creation of a new enemy Islam   or rather of a portrait painted by the powersthatbe of Islam as a terror religion as a hooded villain lurking out there somewhere in the desert waiting to destroy us I knew that attempting to dispel through the patient approach of my childhood the kind of Islamophobia that now had the country by the throat was not going to be enough Post911 attacks on Muslims in the US and elsewhere were not merely childish taunts  For the first time in my life in a country gripped by fear I believed I was witnessing a shift en masse toward an American fundamentalism and ultranationalism that reflected a wanton lack of reason not to mention fact As a boy in Iran I had witnessed the dark destination down which such a path could take a country Now it seemed to me in America s quest to escape the very demons we had sown by our own misadventures in the Middle East and forsaking the hallmarks of our founding we risked becoming everything we sought to defeat  The Boy in the Schoolyard Grown Up  On February 10 2015 three young American students Yusor AbuSalha Razan AbuSalha and Deah Shaddy Barakat were executed at an apartment complex in Chapel Hill North Carolina The killer was a guncrazy white man filled with hate and described by his own daughter as “a monster” Those assassinations struck a special chord of sorrow and loss in me My mom and I cried and prayed together for those students and their families  The incident in Chapel Hill also awoke in me some version of the righteous indignation I had felt so many years earlier in that smokefilled courtyard in Iran I would be damned if I stood by while kids in my country were murdered simply because of their faith It violated every word of the oath I had taken when I joined the military and desecrated every value I held in my heart as a sacred tenet of our nation White nationalists and bigots had by then thrown down the gauntlet for so much of this using Islamophobia to trigger targeted assassinations in the United States This was terrorism pure and simple inspired by hatespeakers here at home  At that moment I reached out to fellow veterans who I thought might be willing to help   and it s true what they say about soul mates being irrevocably drawn to each other When I contacted Veterans For Peace  an organization dedicated to exposing the costs of war and militarism I found the leadership well aware of the inherent dangers of Islamophobia and of the need to confront this new enemy So Executive Director Michael McPhearson formed a committee of vets from around the country to decide how those of us who had donned uniforms to defend this land could best battle the phenomenon   and I of course joined it  From that committee emerged Veterans Challenge Islamophobia VCI It now has organizers in Arizona Georgia New Jersey and Texas and that s just a beginning Totally nonpartisan VCI focuses on politicians of any party who engage in hate speech We ve met with leaders of American Muslim communities sat with them through Ramadan and attended their Iftar dinners to break our fasts together In the wake of the Orlando shooting  we at VCI also mobilized to fight back against attempts to pit the Muslim community against the LGBTQ community  Our group was born of the belief that as American military veterans we had a responsibility to call out bigotry hatred and the perpetuation of endless warfare We want the American Muslim community to know that they have allies and that those allies are indeed veterans as well We stand with them and for them and for those of us who are Muslim among them  Nationalism and xenophobia have no place in American life and I for my part don t think Donald Trump or anyone like him should be able to peddle Islamophobia in an attempt to undermine our national unity Without Islamophobia there no longer exists a “clash of civilizations” Without Islamophobia whatever the problems in the world may be there is no longer an “us vs them” and it s possible to begin reimagining a world of something other than perpetual war  As of now this remains the struggle of my life for despite my intense love for America some of my countrymen increasingly see American Muslims as the “other” the enemy  My Mom taught me as a boy that the only thing that mattered was what was in my heart Now with her in mind and as a representative of VCI when I meet fellow Americans I always remember my childhood experiences with my bullying peers And I still lay myself bare as I did then I give trust to gain trust but always knowing that these days this isn t just a matter of niceties It s a question of life or death It s part of a battle for the soul of our nation  In many ways I still consider myself that boy in the school courtyard in Tehran trying to rescue charred pieces of that flag from those trampling feet It s just that now I m doing it in my own country  Nate Terani is a veteran of the US

            "|FAKE |FAKE      |Share This Baylee Luciani left Screenshot of what Baylee caught on FaceTime right  The closest Baylee Luciani could get to her boyfriend who s attending college in Austin was through video online chat The couple had regular “dates” this way to bridge the 200mile distance between them However the endearing arrangement quickly came to an end after his FaceTime was left on and caught something that left his girlfriend horrified  Baylee had been discussing regular things with her boyfriend Yale Gerstein who was on the other side of the screen on an otherwise average evening This video chat was not unlike all the others she had with Yale from his apartment near Austin Community College until the 19yearold girlfriend heard some scratching sounds after FaceTime had been left on  According to KRON  Baylee was midconversation with Yale when scratches at the door caught both of their attention and he got up from his bed where the computer was to see who was at his door He barely turned the handle to open in when masked men entered the room and beat Yale s face in and slammed him down on his bed while shoving a pistol in his cheek The intruders didn t seem to know or care that FaceTime was still on and Baylee s face seen in the corner was watching everything terrified that she was about to see her boyfriend murdered in front of her as she watched him fight for his life  Admitting that she first thought it was a joke seconds later she came to the horrid realization that he was being robbed and called her dad who was at home with her in Dallas into the room “I was scared because they were saying I m going to blow your head off I m going to kill you” Baylee explained along with the chilling feeling she got when the intruder finally realized the video chat was running and looked right at her in the camera “I m like wow… seriously watching an armed robbery happen to somebody that I care about” she added Screengrabs of intruder forcing Yale down on his bed while Baylee and her father watch on FaceTime in horror  With a clear view of at least one intruder s face Baylee began taking screenshots of the suspect in the act as she and her dad called the police to report what was going on She got the pictures right in time since seconds later the intruder decided to disconnect the computer as he and the suspects took off with thousands of dollars worth of Yale s music equipment Although the boyfriend s life was spared in the traumatizing ordeal for the two of them he said that the thieves took something from him that can t be replaced  “I had just finished my first album as a solo artist” Yale said “That s all lost” since they took the recordings on the equipment which means nothing to the thieves and everything to the victim It s not often that you hear of FaceTime solving crimes or potentially saving lives which is what happened in this case Although it was difficult to watch Baylee being there through technology

            "|REAL |REAL      |Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump made some inaccurate claims during an NBC “commanderinchief” forum on military and veterans issues  • Clinton wrongly claimed Trump supported the war in Iraq after it started while Trump was wrong once again in saying he was against the war before it started  • Trump said that President Obama set a “certain date” for withdrawing troops from Iraq when that date was set before Obama was sworn in  • Trump said that Obama s visits to China Saudi Arabia and Cuba were “the first time in the history the storied history of Air Force One” when “high officials” of a host country did not appear to greet the president Not true  • Clinton said that Trump supports privatizing the Veterans Health Administration That s false Trump said he supports allowing veterans to seek care at either public or private hospitals  • Trump said Clinton made “a terrible mistake on Libya” when she was secretary of State But at the time Trump also supported US action that led to the removal of Moammar Gadhafi from power  • Trump cherrypicked Clinton s words when he claimed Clinton said “vets are being treated essentially just fine” Clinton had said the problems in the Department of Veterans Affairs were not as “widespread” as some Republicans claimed but she went on to acknowledge problems including the issue of wait times for doctors  The forum sponsored by NBC News and the Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America was held Sept 7 at the Intrepid Sea Air  Space Museum in New York City Today show host Matt Lauer and members of the military and veterans in the audience questioned the candidates separately  Trump said he “was totally against the war in Iraq” while Clinton claimed that he supported the Iraq War before and after it started The facts don t support either candidate s strong assertions  Our review of Trump s statements before and after the Iraq War started found no evidence that Trump opposed the war before it started In fact he expressed mild support for invading Iraq when asked about it on the Howard Stern radio show on Sept 11 2002   about six months before the war started  Stern asked Trump if he supported a war with Iraq and Trump responded “Yeah I guess so”  In the NBC commander in chief forum Trump cited an Esquire article that appeared in August 2004 to show his opposition to the war But that article appeared 17 months after the war started  As for Clinton who as a senator voted in October 2002 to authorize the war in Iraq the Democratic nominee claimed that Trump “supported it before it happened he supported it as it was happening and he is on record as supporting it after it happened”  But just as there is no evidence that Trump opposed the Iraq War before it started the Clinton campaign offered no evidence that Trump supported the war “after it happened”  The Clinton campaign cited Trump s interview on March 21 2003 with Neil Cavuto of Fox Business just two days after the war started  Cavuto asked Trump about the impact of the war on the stock market Trump said the war “looks like a tremendous success from a military standpoint” and he predicted the market will “go up like a rocket” after the war But Cavuto does not ask Trump whether the US should have gone to war with Iraq or whether he supports the war and Trump doesn t offer an opinion  As early as July 2003 Trump expressed concern on Hardball with Chris Matthews about money being spent in Iraq rather than in the US Two months later Trump told MSNBC s Joe Scarborough “I guess maybe if I had to do it I would have fought terrorism but not necessarily Iraq”  Clinton invited her audience to read Trump s comments on the Iraq War They can read our timeline “Donald Trump and the Iraq War”  Trump said President Obama set a “certain date” for withdrawing troops from Iraq but that date was actually set by President George W Bush  NBC s Matt Lauer asked Trump about his tendency to respond when pushed for details on his military proposals that he s not going to give details because he wants to be “unpredictable” Trump responded “Absolutely” and went on to criticize Obama for revealing the withdrawal date  As we said then Republicans and Democrats disagree on whether Obama or Bush is to blame for withdrawing all combat troops from Iraq at the end of 2011 But that date was set when Bush signed the Status of Forces Agreement on Dec 14 2008 It said “All the United States Forces shall withdraw from all Iraqi territory no later than December 31 2011”  In the NBC forum Trump also called the withdrawal of troops “a terrible decision” As we ve explained before Condoleezza Rice Bush s secretary of State later wrote that Bush wanted an agreement for a residual force to remain but Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri alMaliki objected  Once Obama took office in January 2009 he had three years to renegotiate the deal which his administration tried to do to leave a residual American troop force But Maliki still didn t agree Negotiations broke down in October 2011 over the issue of whether US troops would be shielded from criminal prosecution by Iraqi authorities Whether Obama did enough is a matter of opinion His then defense secretary Leon Panetta later wrote that the president didn t press hard enough for a deal But some experts say Iraq was more closely aligned at the time with Iran and there wasn t a deal to be made with Maliki  So both presidents had a role in the withdrawal of troops But Trump wrongly said that Obama was the one who set a “certain date” for withdrawal and let US enemies know about it when that date was set before Obama was sworn in  It s worth noting that Trump said in a March 16 2007 interview on CNN that the troops should be withdrawn quickly from Iraq  Trump said that Obama s visits to China Saudi Arabia and Cuba were “the first time in the history the storied history of Air Force One” when “high officials” of a host country did not appear to greet the president  That s not true Other presidents have encountered similar lowkey greetings on foreign trips aboard the presidential aircraft  Trump referred to the fact that Cuba s president Raul Castro did not greet Obama at the airport on his historic visit to Cuba in March that Saudi Arabia s King Salman did not meet Air Force One at the start of Obama s trip to Riyadh in April and he referred to China s handling of the president s arrival in Hangzhou last Saturday for a Group of 20 meeting  Whether or not those arrivals constituted snubs of a US president as Trump claims is a matter of debate But Trump is wrong on the facts when he claims it has not happened before It has  In 1984 for example Ronald Reagan landed in Beijing and was received by China s foreign minister rather than the president whom he met only later Similarly on a 1985 trip to West Germany Reagan was met by the foreign minister and not Chancellor Helmut Kohl  These and other examples were dug up by our friend Glenn Kessler the Washington Post s “Fact Checker” who researched a Trump claim in April that Cuba s and Saudi Arabia s handling of Obama s visits were “without precedent” Kessler said of Trump “once again he s wrong wrong wrong”  Kessler also noted that during Richard Nixon s historic 1972 visit to China he was greeted at the airport by the country s number two man Premier Zhou Enlai His boss Chairman Mao didn t even agree to meet with Nixon until after he had arrived at a guest house  Clinton said that her plan to overhaul the Veterans Health Administration would not include privatization which she said Trump supports  But Trump refuted that statement when it was his turn to discuss his plan to help veterans “I would not do that” Trump said referring to Clinton s claim that he supports privatization  Trump s campaign published “The Goals Of Donald J Trump s Veterans Plan” on its website last October It doesn t call for the VA to be completely privatized  One of the biggest changes that plan would make to the current VA health care system is allowing veterans to get care at any nonVA medical center that accepts Medicare  “Under a Trump Administration all veterans eligible for VA health care can bring their veteran s ID card to any doctor or care facility that accepts Medicare to get the care they need immediately” the plan states  “The power to choose will stop the wait time backlogs and force the VA to improve and compete if the department wants to keep receiving veterans  healthcare dollars” the plan says  Trump s proposal would seemingly go further than the NonVA Medical Care Program which allows eligible veterans to access care outside of the VA under certain circumstances such as when VA medical centers cannot provide services The program requires preapproval for veterans to receive care at a nonVA facility in nonemergency situations  Trump s proposal would also go further than the bipartisan Veterans Choice Act of 2014 that President Obama signed into law creating a temporary program separate from the NonVA Medical Care Program that allows eligible veterans to receive health care at a nonVA facility if they would have to wait more than 30 days for an appointment at a VA medical center or if they live more than 40 miles from the nearest VA hospital  Trump stuck to the idea of allowing veterans to choose between public and private hospitals when he released his most recent “Ten Point Plan To Reform The VA” in July  Point 10 of the plan says “Mr Trump will ensure every veteran has the choice to seek care at the VA or at a private service provider of their own choice Under a Trump Administration no veteran will die waiting for service”  Trump reinforced that part of his plan during the NBC News forum as well  To be clear Trump supports giving veterans a choice between VA hospitals and private ones That s not the same thing as supporting the complete privatization of the system that provides care to veterans  Trump criticized Clinton for making “a terrible mistake on Libya” when she was secretary of State But at the time Trump also supported US action that led to the removal of Moammar Gadhafi from power  Trump made his claim in response to a question posed by Lauer on whether Trump will be “prepared on Day One” if elected president to tackle “complex national security issues”  This isn t the first time Trump has ignored his past support for the US intervention in Libya  During the 10th GOP debate Trump said he had “never discussed that subject” when Sen Ted Cruz called him out on supporting US action in the country But as we wrote Trump said in 2011 that the US should go into Libya “on a humanitarian basis” and “knock Gadhafi out very quickly very surgically very effectively and save the lives”  Trump made that comment in a video posted to his YouTube channel in February 2011  Even though Trump now says Clinton s support for intervention in Libya was a “terrible mistake” it doesn t change the fact that five years ago he supported Gadhafi s removal  Trump twisted Clinton s words when he claimed Clinton said “vets are being treated essentially just fine” Clinton said the problems in the Department of Veterans Affairs were not as “widespread” as some Republican supporters of privatization of the VA claim but she went on to acknowledge problems in the VA system   including the issue of wait times for doctors   and what she would do to address them  Trump highlighted the issue of wait times to see a doctor as “one of the big problems” in the VA and then suggested Clinton doesn t think the VA has problems  Lauer interrupted noting that Clinton “went on after that and laid out a litany of problems within the VA”  Trump insisted his version was accurate adding “I m telling you … she said she was satisfied with what was going on in the Veterans Administration”  That s not accurate The comments in question from Clinton came during an interview with MSNBC s Rachel Maddow on Oct 23 2015 Maddow asked about talk among some Republicans of abolishing the VA and privatizing it “The reason they are able to propose something that radical is because the problems at the VA seem so intractable” Maddow said  Maddow asked if Clinton had any “new ideas for trying to fix” the VA Here was Clinton s response with the part Trump is referring to in bold  Clinton accused Republicans of underfunding the VA because they “want it to fail” so they can privatize it  Clinton added “But we have to be more creative about trying to fix the problems that are the legitimate concern so that we can try to stymie the Republican assault”  Indeed the Clinton campaign website states that Clinton wants to “fundamentally reform veterans  health care to ensure access to timely and high quality care” The campaign says Clinton “was outraged by the recent scandals at the VA and as president she will demand accountability and performance from VA leadership” The site specifically mentions Clinton s dissatisfaction that “many veterans have to wait an unacceptably long time to see a doctor or to process disability claims and appeals” and promises she will “build a 21stcentury Department of Veterans Affairs to deliver worldclass care”  Trump cherrypicked the part of Clinton s response that said problems in the VA have “not been as widespread as it has been made out to be” to make the blanket claim that Clinton is “satisfied with what was going on in the Veterans Administration” and that “vets are being treated essentially just fine” But Trump is leaving out the parts of Clinton s answer that acknowledged problems in the VA   including the wait time issue Trump highlighted as one of his biggest concerns



            "|REAL |REAL      |Iranian negotiators reportedly have made a lastditch push for more concessions from the US and five other world powers as talks on the fate of Irans nuclear program come down to the final days before a crucial deadline  The New York Times reported late Sunday that Tehran had backed away from a tentative promise to ship a large portion of its uranium stockpile to Russia where it could not be used as part of any future weapons program Western officials insisted to the paper that the uranium did not have to be sent overseas but could be disposed of in other ways  The new twist in the talks comes just two days before the deadline for both sides to agree on a framework for a permanent deal The final deadline for a permanent deal would not arrive until the end of June  However if Iran insists on keeping its uranium in the country it would undermine a key argument made in favor of the deal by the Obama administration The Times reports that if the uranium had gone to Russia it would have been converted into fuel rods which are difficult to use in nuclear weapons It is not clear what would happen to the uranium if it remained in Iran  The Associated Press reported Sunday that Irans position had shifted from from demanding that it be allowed to keep nearly 10000 centrifuges enriching uranium to agreeing to keep 6000 Western officials involved in the talks told the Associated Press that Tehran may be ready to accept an even lower number  The United States and its allies want a deal that extends the time Iran would need to make a nuclear weapon from the present two months to three months to at least a year However The Times reported Sunday that a paper published by Olli Heinonen former head of inspections for the UNs nuclear watchdog estimated that Iran could still develop a nuclear weapon in seven or eight months with around 6500 centrifuges  Tehran says it wants to enrich uranium only for energy science industry and medicine But many countries fear Iran could use the technology to make weaponsgrade uranium  Officials told the Associated Press that another main dispute involved the length of an agreement Iran they said wants a total lifting of all caps on its activities after 10 years while the US and the five other nations at the talks   Russia China Britain France and Germany   insist on progressive removal after a decade  A senior US official characterized the issue as lack of agreement on what happens in years 11 to 15 The official spoke on condition of anonymity in line with State Department rules on briefing about the closeddoor talks  Limits on Irans research and development of centrifuges also were unresolved the Western officials said  Tehran has created a prototype centrifuge that it says enriches uranium 16 times faster than its present mainstay model The US and its partners want to constrain research that would increase greatly the speed of making enough weaponsgrade uranium for a bomb once limits on Irans programs are lifted  One official said Russia opposed the US position that any UN penalties lifted in the course of a deal should be reimposed quickly if Tehran reneged on any commitments  Both Western officials said Iran was resisting attempts to make inspections and other ways of verification as intrusive as possible  There was tentative agreement on turning a nearlyfinished reactor into a model that gives off less plutonium waste than originally envisaged Plutonium like enriched uranium is a path to nuclear weapons  Iran and the US were discussing letting Iran run centrifuges at an underground bunker that has been used to enrich uranium The machines would produce isotopes for peaceful applications the officials said  With the Tuesday deadline approaching and problems remaining US Secretary of State John Kerry canceled plans Sunday to return to the United States for an event honoring the late US Sen Edward Kennedy French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius and FrankWalter Steinmeier his German counterpart scratched planned trips to Kazakhstan  Kerry has been in discussions with Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif since Thursday  The Associated Press

            "|REAL |REAL      |CEDAR RAPIDS Iowa   “I had one of the most wonderful rallies of my entire career right here in 1992” Bill Clinton said by way of opening to the crowd of more than 1100 on Saturday night  Two days before the Iowa caucuses Cedar Rapids tried to deliver that same old feeling to his wife Hillary Clinton  In the crowd one woman held a sign that said “227 years of men It s HER turn Some carried signs and books Others had traveled from as far as Missouri They had waited hours even after the fire marshal told them there was no more room inside the high school gymnasium  The restive crowd chanted slogans and buzzed with anticipation until finally Bill Hillary and Chelsea Clinton all appeared on stage handinhand an hour behind schedule As they roared Hillary Clinton beamed  It has been a long slog in Iowa for the Clinton campaign which has struggled mightily to shake the label that its supporters can t muster the enthusiasm of its rival s backers As the caucuses near and with the help of a former president the energy level at her events are notably dialing up  Hes a charismatic speaker said Cigi Ross 31 In general Id say hes a bigger draw for people  Monday night will put the campaigns months of their work to the test Can the campaign s organization bring out their supporters Can the candidate energize voters  Clinton who seemed to draw on the higherthanusual energy stood at the center of it all and delivered a confident closing statement  “What we need is a plan and a commitment” Clinton said at the top of her voice  “And me yes thank you” Clinton finished  Eight years later Clinton is in Iowa once again facing what could be a nailbiting conclusion of a hardfought campaign Clinton acknowledges that it isn t just her campaign that has changed since her devastating loss here in her last run she too has changed   and improved she told CNN on Saturday  I think I am a different and perhaps a better candidate so I hope that also shows Clinton said in an interview with the network that morning  Days ago Iowa seemed to be slipping from her grasp but campaign aides are feeling more confident now A slew of positive news endorsements and the latest poll from the Des Moines Register and Bloomberg News indicate the bleeding has at least slowed That poll  considered the gold standard in Iowa  gave Clinton a slim lead over her rival Vermont Sen Bernie Sanders  If Democrats are wary of political dynasties they didn t show it Spotting someone in the audience carrying Chelsea Clintons book her father remarked Thank you young woman for holding up her book  Bill Clinton who has spent days crisscrossing the state on his wifes behalf has settled easily into this role as boosterinchief He lays off the policy leaving that to his wife He focuses instead on what he knows about the job  “There are certain almost intangible qualities that determine whether a president succeeds or not” Clinton said his voice raspy even and low You need a sticker A sticker someone who won t quit on you”  She s the best at that I ve ever known” he added

            "|REAL |REAL      |Donald Trump s organizational problems have gone from bad to worse to flatout embarrassing Here s Politico with the playbyplay from this weekend s Colorado GOP convention the latest scene of Trump s delegatesecuring failure  Unlike in most other states Republicans in Colorado scrapped plans for a more traditional primary or caucus to award its delegates to this summer s national convention in Cleveland Instead the state GOP selected three delegates from each of the state s seven congressional districts at individual contests in the days leading up to the state convention and then the remaining 13 delegates at the statewide event this past weekend It was a rather convoluted process that favored campaigns that understood the rules and that had the ground game necessary to take advantage of them or put another way not the Trump campaign  At the first two districtlevel contests the billionaire s team showed up without an approved list of delegates to pass out to attendees leaving supporters unsure of whom to back And then at last Thursday s contest two of the three delegates on the Trump campaign s list weren t actually on the official ballot since they failed to pay the necessary registration fees  This past weekend s mixup though was an even bigger embarrassment since at least one of the seven misnumbered names on the Trumpsanctioned list lined up with a Cruzsupporting delegate according to NBC News Even without that mixup though Cruz would have likely swept the contest anyway given his welloiled delegateselecting machine The Trump camp though appeared to blame the state GOP for the mistake pointing to discrepancies between the delegate guides posted on the partys website and the printed materials distributed at the event “Well do whatever it takes to protect the legitimacy of our support in Colorado” Trump aide Alan Cobb told NBC suggesting the campaign may challenge the results “Clearly there are some serious issues with the ballot and balloting”  Trump remains the favorite to arrive at the convention with the most delegates to his name but he s far from assured of the majority of delegates he d need to win the nomination on the first ballot Given that reality the GOP frontrunner recently retooled his campaign to address his clear weaknesses in the undertheradar battle to send loyal delegates to the convention If those efforts dont start paying dividends soon though Trump very well may arrive in Cleveland with the most delegates and leave without the nomination

            "|REAL |REAL      |As more women move into high offices they often bring a style and approach that is distinct from men But do they make better leaders  Democratic women of the US Senate stand on stage during the final night of the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia top There are 20 women in the Senate  14 Democrats and six Republicans  Kelly Ayotte and Joni Ernst take the floor two dynamic young US senators before a town hall of older military veterans Between them they represent a raft of firsts Senator Ayotte is New Hampshire s first female attorney general and first female Republican senator Senator Ernst is Iowa s first woman ever elected to either house of Congress and the first female military veteran to serve in the Senate  The gender dimension does not go unnoticed Please welcome “our beautiful senators” says the veteran who introduces them Ayotte mentions Ernst s military service  she s also a war veteran But in most ways the woman thing doesn t matter This is just like any other political town hall in campaign season  one senator trying to help another who s locked in a tight reelection race  Yet the stakes are high Republican control of the US Senate could hinge on Ayotte s ability to fend off her Democratic challenger Gov Maggie Hassan And across the country women figure prominently in the Democrats  strategy to retake the Senate nominating women in six of the 11 competitive races  Then there s Hillary Clinton the first woman to win a major party s presidential nomination in the United States  It s enough to call 2016 Year of the Woman 20 following the original 1992 when female representation in the Senate jumped from two to six Today female senators number 20 out of 100 with potential to reach 24 depending on how the political winds are blowing by Election Day  Gender diversity among major world powers is also rising with the ascension of Theresa May to the British prime ministership If Mrs Clinton wins in November three of the world s top five economies will be headed by women German Chancellor Angela Merkel is the other  But the numbers and the “firsts” invite a deeper question Do women really lead differently From the halls of government to corporate boardrooms it s a burning question  “I think we re good listeners and I think that helps” says Ayotte in an interview “I don t want to say my male colleagues aren t because plenty of them are But I think that we listen and so we re picking up on where we see the common ground with other people”  On that point there is bipartisan agreement  “There is good research that shows women tend to have different leadership styles” Democratic Sen Jeanne Shaheen New Hampshire s other senator says in an interview “We tend to be more inclusive we re less autocratic in our decisionmaking We like consensus we like to get people around the table and so I think that has made a difference”  Of course there s also the example of Rep Nancy Pelosi D of California the first woman speaker of the House 200711 During her tenure she was known for her ability to wield power  and in a highly partisan way More than with previous speakers major legislation came out of her office not the committees She was and is a master fundraiser for Democrats writ large a skill she has used to great effect in keeping her members in line  And as a Roman Catholic woman Congresswoman Pelosi demonstrated at a crucial moment the power of networking In 2010 when House passage of the Affordable Care Act appeared in doubt over the abortion issue she tapped connections her male colleagues had never heard of  two associations of nuns whose support for the bill proved pivotal  The research on women s leadership style has been extensive  and mixed One academic study released in 2013 found that women are more attracted to cooperation than men The reason is that men tend to have greater confidence in their abilities while women tend to be more optimistic about their prospective teammates  abilities according to the study by Peter Kuhn and MarieClaire Villeval  New research released in August looked specifically at gender differences in the US House of Representatives and found “little evidence to suggest women are inherently more cooperative or bipartisan” The only difference came with Republican women who tend to recruit more cosponsors on legislation including more from the opposite party That tendency was most pronounced on socalled women s issues such as education and social welfare  “We interpret these results as evidence that cooperation is mostly driven by a commonality of interest rather than gender per se” write the authors Stefano Gagliarducci and M Daniele Paserman  The study examined 20 years of data ending in 2008 Since then female representation in Congress has ticked up a notch reaching 20 percent in the Senate and nearly that in the House  the rough threshold for a perceived “critical mass” of representation in which women can show perceptible influence  Indeed since 2013 female legislators point to multiple examples of how the women of the Senate in particular have been instrumental in breaking through congressional gridlock The bestknown example is the end of the 2013 government shutdown when women senators from both parties met privately over dinner and fashioned a compromise that would form the nucleus of the final deal  More recently the women of the Senate  all 20 of them dubbed “the sisterhood”  backed landmark legislation aimed at combating sex trafficking which President Obama signed into law in May 2015  When asked for other examples Senator Shaheen cites the 2013 reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act “It was considered dead” she says “and because all the women senators got on board and pushed it we were able to get it through”  Shaheen also notes the growing number of women who serve in top spots on committees such as the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee with Sen Lisa Murkowski R of Alaska as chair and Sen Maria Cantwell D of Washington as the ranking member “It looks like we may get an energy bill done this year and I think that speaks to their ability to work together and to be flexible and move our colleagues in the House” Shaheen says  Behind all this female power are the women senators  regular dinners a chance to kick back and talk about whatever  their lives their work their male colleagues  “We go by Mikulski s rules  that what happens in those dinners stays in those dinners” says Shaheen referring to Sen Barbara Mikulski D of Maryland the longestserving woman in congressional history who is about to retire “But yeah they ve proved to be a great opportunity to build relationships”  As it happens Shaheen had hosted 12 of her female colleagues the night before at her office On the menu lobsters and clam chowder That much she will reveal Sen Susan Collins R of Maine was there Shaheen says “and we had a back and forth about whether the lobsters came from Maine or New Hampshire”  In 2013 after the Senate s 20 women helped end the government shutdown Sen John McCain R of Arizona wondered out loud “Imagine what they could do if there were 50 of them”  That may sound logical but the reality isn t so simple While women do bring a distinctive perspective to policy based on their life experiences that doesn t necessarily make them less partisan experts say Some of the most polarizing issues are socalled women s issues including health care abortion and equal pay  “As long as women s issues constitute a prominent division between the parties there will be little bipartisan collaboration among women on these policies” Michele Swers a political scientist at Georgetown University wrote in The Washington Post in 2014  Ms Swers also notes that partisan sorting has made the South  a region less hospitable to women candidates  the stronghold of the Republican Party while the more moderate brand of Republicanism that predominates in parts of the country more willing to elect women has declined  And because women tend to occupy the “leftward wing” of their respective parties Democratic women in particular are less inclined to compromise the GagliarducciPaserman study found  Still none of this means women shouldn t be more rigorously recruited for public office say leaders of both parties  “What you need is more good people and the process of excluding women has excluded good people from service” says former Gov John Sununu R of New Hampshire “So what you need to do is level the playing field”  In the business world boosting female representation on corporate boards  now near 20 percent  has been a longheld goal Advocates cite benefits to the bottom line In a famous study Catalyst Inc a nonprofit that promotes women leaders in the workplace found that corporate boards with the highest female representation attained “significantly higher financial performance” than those with the lowest representation  But whether in the private sector or in government women as top executives are even rarer than women legislators Only six of the nation s 50 governors are women three Republicans and three Democrats Among world leaders fewer than two dozen are female Among Fortune 500 companies only 21 chief executive officers  or 42 percent  are women  While legislating is an inherently collaborative process and therefore seems to play to women s strength executive roles hew more toward public expectations of how men should behave ie authoritatively  “I think the more people see women in executive positions the more they will see that as a normal course of business and it s taken longer for that not just in politics but in the boardroom” says Shaheen  But that becomes a Catch22 Women don t step up because they don t see other women in those positions “Some would call it a confidence gap” says Liz Shuler the No 2 leader at the AFLCIO “We need to do more to increase the leadership skillsbuilding opportunities so that it becomes second nature for women to step up” See interview with Ms Shuler here  But do women executives really lead differently from men Clinton echoes other women leaders on this point “I just think women in general are better listeners are more collegial more open to new ideas and how to make things work in a way that looks for a winwin outcome” she told Time magazine in January  Metaanalyses have found that women leaders on average are “more likely to be democratic collaborative and participative” than their male counterparts who are more likely to be “autocratic and directive” in their approach writes Alice H Eagly at TheConversationcom  Of course there are exceptions Margaret Thatcher of Britain and Golda Meir of Israel were both known for being tough and assertive Today Apple CEO Tim Cook is known for his teamoriented style But for women aspiring to leadership posts the challenge is to overcome societal expectations for how women are “supposed to” act  ie nice and nonconfrontational  while still projecting authority Clinton has faced this “double bind” in both of her presidential campaigns  New Hampshire has a strong record of female leadership The governor both US senators and one of the state s two House members are women The chief justice of the state Supreme Court is a woman The chair of the state GOP is a woman  In 2008 Granite Staters made history by electing the nation s first majorityfemale state legislative body in the state Senate In 2013 the state made history again by sending an allfemale congressional delegation to Washington That could happen again in January  What is it about New Hampshire that breeds women leaders Start with a culture of independentmindedness and an enormous “citizens legislature”  400 in the House 24 in the Senate  in a state with only 13 million people Members are paid just $100 a year plus mileage Sooner or later the joke goes everybody ends up serving  “We have so much local selfgovernance women have the opportunity to try things out to see how they like public service and then they discover that they like it and that they re good at it and one thing leads to the next” says Governor Hassan in an interview in the State House  Hassan got her start advocating for her disabled son which caught the notice of thenGovernor Shaheen who appointed her to a state educational funding commission That led to regular interactions with state legislators  and an introduction to her next mentor state Sen Sylvia Larsen who encouraged Hassan to run for state Senate She spent six years there eventually rising to majority leader losing reelection then staging a comeback by winning the governorship  The common denominator for most women in politics it seems is mentors Ask Ayotte New Hampshire s junior senator about Ruth Griffin and her eyes light up “I love Ruth Griffin She s my mentor” Ayotte gushes referring to the nonagenarian grand dame of the New Hampshire Republican Party See interview with Mrs Griffin here  When Griffin served on the state Executive Council  an elected board that serves as a check on the governor  she advocated strongly for Ayotte insisting the Democratic governor reappoint the Republican Ayotte as attorney general  Shaheen now a mentor to others cites as her inspiration Marilla Ricker the first woman to run for governor of New Hampshire  before women even had the right to vote Shaheen also speaks fondly of the late Susan McLane a Republican state senator “who was always very good to me” Ms McLane s daughter is Rep Ann McLane Kuster D of New Hampshire Shaheen broke two gender barriers in NH first with her election as governor 1996 then as a US senator 2008  Men too have championed women politicians here At a recent Republican women s chili fest in Stratham NH Mr Sununu recalls fighting to make Vesta Roy the first woman state Senate president in 1983 “There s that classic picture of me standing at the state Senate door cracked open peeking in to make sure the 13 votes I had lined up for her stayed with her” Sununu says  Whether New Hampshire s success at electing women to higher office can be duplicated elsewhere remains an open question Only two other states have two female US senators and five others have female governors New Hampshire is no longer the champ at electing women state legislators that crown belongs to Colorado with 42 percent The top 10 states for female representation in state legislatures are mostly Northern and the bottom 10 mostly Southern suggesting cultural factors  Overall women hold a higher percentage of state legislative seats 246 percent than seats in Congress 194 percent House and Senate combined At least the female “farm team” has more players than the “major league” though those numbers still fall far short of matching the overall female population of the country 508 percent  For many women reaching parity with men in government  and in business the judiciary the labor movement and other spheres of life  is a deeply held goal But a quick glance at the graphs charting female representation in state and national legislatures reveals a stark truth Growth has nearly hit a plateau  If progress continues at the current rate of change since 1960 women will not achieve equal representation in Congress until 2117 according to the Institute for Women s Policy Research Women s representation in state legislatures which more than quintupled between 1971 and 2015 has also essentially plateaued What s going on  “It s not that women are running in droves and losing” says Debbie Walsh director of the Center for American Women and Politics at Rutgers University in New Brunswick NJ “We know that when women run they win at about the same rate as men do”  Women also do just as well in fundraising as men even if they have to work harder to raise the same amount Part of the problem Ms Walsh says comes in the recruitment process Much of the recruiting is done by white men and they recruit who they know  other white men  That is particularly so among Republicans Only 17 percent of Republican state lawmakers are women a rate that hasn t changed since the early 1990s In contrast Democrats doubled their rate of female state representation during the same period from 15 percent to 30 percent  In Congress both houses the disparity is even more stark Only 9 percent of Republicans are female versus 33 percent of Democrats In the Senate alone only six of the 20 women members are Republican  Walsh cites several factors behind this gap Republican women are perceived to be more moderate than their male counterparts and can have a harder time making it out of the primaries where turnout is low and skews conservative The GOP also has no counterpart to Emily s List  a wellfunded political action committee that helps proabortionrights Democratic women get elected And then there s the simple fact that more women identify as Democrats so their recruitment pool is bigger  In New Hampshire where both legislative chambers are controlled by the Republicans Democratic women legislators still outnumber Republican women legislators 73 to 49 State GOP chair Jennifer Horn says the party  nationally not just in New Hampshire  needs a message that s more inclusive  “I m being diplomatic  I think there are times when some of the folks in our party are not as sensitive to the fact that men and women see the world differently” says Ms Horn “When we re talking about jobs and the economy for example we need to be cognizant of the fact that women are an economic engine in and of themselves”  And then there s the fact that in both parties women are less likely than men to run for office without being recruited  In the Monitor s conversations with Ernst and Ayotte both mentioned how they were asked several times to run for the Senate before saying yes  and both brought up family issues Without using the word “multitasking” they both show that they have mastered that classic skill of the working mom  “It s about getting the message out about empowering women and saying you can do this” says Ernst “It is important that you have a supportive family even more so for women I have a teenage daughter right now  we re looking at colleges  and sometimes it s hard for a woman to be away But there are ways of making it work”  Before running for Senate Ayotte had been asked a couple of times to run for Congress but declined  in part she says because she was pregnant but also because she had plans in her work as a prosecutor  Ayotte then excuses herself “I ve got to pick up my daughter before 530 or I m in trouble”|\n",

            "|FAKE |FAKE      |0  Hillary Clinton has barely just lost the presidential election and here she is already getting herself caught in another one of her tangled web of lies  The day after losing a picture was posted of her taking her dog out for a walk The picture was reportedly from a random hiker she ran into and showed that she was getting back to public life or that s what she wants you to believe  Now I want you to do me a favor and take a very close look at this picture specifically the “hiker” she met Memorize her face…  Got it Okay good  Now what I am about to show you is something Hillary Clinton was hoping nobody else would notice Tell me if the girl in the 2nd picture taken in the 2000 s reminds you of anyone  Yeah it is the EXACT SAME GIRL  Her name is Margot Gerster and her mother just happens to be one of the big fundraisers for Hillary That s actually where the older picture was taken  Wow That doesn t seem random at all does it  It looks like this is yet another example of Hillary Clinton trying to mislead the public using her inner circle and pretending like she doesn t know them  All I gotta say is give it the Hell up Hillary You lost nobody needs to see your “chance encounters” or other promotional propaganda anymore This is exactly why Americans ended up hating you  Oh well I guess you really cannot teach an old dog new tricks Well in that case all that s left to do is share this all across Facebook and the internet and expose yet another one of her Serial Lies

            "|REAL |REAL      |Washington CNN For months the White House and Congress have wrangled over a bill that would give lawmakers a greater say in the Iran nuclear deal the administration is hammering out along with other world powers  And now less than two weeks after a framework agreement with Tehran was reached the Senate Foreign Relations Committee is planning to take up the measure  On Tuesday the committee will consider amendments to Tennessee Republican Sen Bob Corkers Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act before deciding whether to have the full Senate vote on it  For many in Congress its a very simple premise Congress should weigh in on the terms of a final nuclear deal with Iran  But for the White House and some Democrats in Congress thats an explosive idea that could derail the talks   and therefore must be stopped  So whats in the bill  Supporters of the legislation have emphasized that it would allow Congress to give a thumbs up or down on the deal President Barack Obama is aiming to finalize with Iran by the negotiations June 30 deadline Backers think thats only fair since the United States is contemplating a major nuclear pact with a decadeslong enemy  The bill would give Congress a chance to hold hearings host briefings and pave the way to a vote on a joint resolution that could express approval or disapproval of the deal It also requires the Obama administration to quickly report to Congress on details of the deal and regularly assess whether Iran is keeping its commitments And it spells out what the President needs to do visavis Congress if Iran is found violating the terms  But most important it would keep Obama from waiving any congressional sanctions on Iran during Congress 60day review period And if Congress passes a joint resolution of disapproval then sanctions could not be lifted even after that time  Does this hurt the diplomatic effort to reach a final deal  Irans primary reason for agreeing to the deals limits on its nuclear program is to get sanctions relief  Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and President Hassan Rouhani have insisted sanctions must be lifted on Day One of the deal While the Obama administration has said it would wait several months before lifting sanctions  to verify that Iran has taken major steps to roll back its program   the President is counting on having some latitude to waive sanctions in order to give Iran an incentive to sign the deal and then keep its commitments  The Corker bill makes it less likely sanctions would be lifted and lifted in a timely way which gives less encouragement to Iran  Without the bill could Obama lift all sanctions on Iran  Not all but most   at least for a limited time  Without the CorkerMenendez bill named after Corker and lead Democratic cosponsor Sen Bob Menendez Iran could see nearly all nuclearrelated sanctions at least temporarily lifted Those enacted through the United Nations and by presidential executive order could be fully removed and most of those passed by Congress could be waived by Obama until he leaves office when they would go back into effect unless the next president continues to waive them  If the CorkerMenendez bill becomes law and a deal is finalized Obama wouldnt be able to lift the congressional sanctions for at least 60 days  During that 60day review phase the bill says Obama cant waive suspend reduce provide relief from or otherwise limit the application of statutory sanctions  How can Obama waive sanctions passed by Congress anyway  The biggest sanctions package approved by Congress widely credited with crippling Irans economy and bringing the country to the negotiating table was the 2010 Comprehensive Iran Sanctions Accountability and Divestment Act  It included a provision that gives the President leverage to waive sanctions for a limited time if he determines its in the US national security interest  He wouldnt be able to permanently sunset the sanctions though unless Iran cuts its ties with and stops funding terror organizations around the world an aspect not being addressed in the current negotiations with Iran and not predicted to happen any time soon  The administration says sanctions are where Congress could eventually weigh in on the Iran deal  by repealing them  but that would only happen if lawmakers deem the deal a good one  How would Congress weigh in during the 60day review period  Congress could pass a joint resolution approving of the deal or disapproving of the deal and forbidding any sanctions relief Or it could do nothing allowing Obama to implement the sanctions and by implication the deal after the 60 days are up  A joint resolution disapproving of the deal would need to muster a twothirds majority though to override the veto Obama has promised  an unlikely but not entirely unthinkable scenario  Are there other reasons that Obama opposes this bill  First hes facing a combative Republican majority in both houses of Congress Those Republicans have sought to undermine his negotiations with Iran at every turn Giving those lawmakers a legislative avenue to slam the terms of an eventual deal would at best be a political blow to Obama and his administrations efforts to broker an agreement  Theres also the White Houses argument that the executive branch has the power to broker international agreements without Congress meddling while congressional oversight of the Iran deal would set a dangerous precedent Most international agreements arent treaties ratified by Congress and Obama has argued that US allies need to know they can count on those agreements holding up  Virtually every Senate Republican supports the bill and nine Democrats have signed on as cosponsors including independent Sen Angus King who caucuses with Democrats Several more on the left are leaning toward supporting the bill  That means backers will likely pass the bill with a filibusterproof majority Its unclear though if they can muster enough Democrats willing to vote to override Obamas veto  Its not just the numbers though Some powerful Democrats are supporting the legislation Sen Chuck Schumer of New York the No 3 Senate Democrat who will become the chambers Democratic leader when Minority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada retires at the end of his term is a big proponent of the legislation  Menendez of New Jersey who has been working to rally Democrats around legislation on Iran throughout the negotiations remains the most vocal Democrat on the issue He was the topranked Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee until stepping aside to face corruption charges handed down earlier in the month  Also Sen Tim Kaine of Virginia one of the earliest Obama backers during the 2008 campaign has been insistent on the need for Congress to weigh in and has worked behind the scenes to make Corkers bill more palatable to Democrats  and the White House But so far that effort hasnt succeeded as the White House remains opposed

            "|REAL |REAL      |While paging through Pews best data visualizations of 2014 its awesome I came across what I believe to be one of the best and most revealing charts about the state of American politics Here it is  The chart which comes from Pews amazing political polarization project shows how partisans of both parties have grown both increasingly unified amongst themselves and increasingly far apart from their partisan others over just the last 20 years As recently as 1994 seven in 10 Democrats were more consistently liberal than the median Republican  As of 2014 its a whopping 94 percent Same goes for Republicans 64 percent of GOPers were more consistently conservative than the median Democrat in 1994 while 92 percent are today In addition the overall share of Americans who express consistently conservative or consistently liberal opinions has doubled over the past two decades from 10 percent to 21 percent according to Pew  To me this chart is so important  particularly in a week where a new Congress arrives in Washington  because it reveals that the polarization of our elected officials isnt some sort of only in Washington thing  The increasing partisanship of Congress is a direct reflection of the increasing partisanship of the country After all thats who elects these people to Congress right  So when you hear people decry the partisanship of their elected officials in Washington dont believe it  We have the Congress we want  even if we arent totally honest with ourselves all the time about what that is  And we get the results  not many  from our elected officials that you have to expect when you have a country as polarized as ours

            "|REAL |FAKE      |After a week of nonstop criticism from Democrats and Republicans alike for comments many condemned as racially charged Donald Trump claims to be altering his campaign to be a little more inclusive While the presumptive GOP has long promised to “make America great again” Trump now says he s adding two words to slogan to illustrate just how nonracist he really is  “You know I have the theme  make America great again  and Ive added a couple of things” Trump announced to supporters at a campaign rally in Richmond Virginia on Friday night “Right now I m adding make America great again I m adding  for everyone  because it s really going to be for everyone It s not going to be for a group of people it s going to be for everyone It s true”  The allegedly amended slogan which has yet to appear on any official signage or Trump merchandise comes after the presidential candidate spent the first half of June repeatedly denouncing Gonzalo Curiel the federal judge of Mexican heritage presiding over the Trump University class action lawsuit as inherently biased against him Curiel was born in Indiana His comments were widely condemned by the Washington political establishment including Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell who suggested he may be an idiot and House Speaker Paul Ryan who called Trump s statement the “textbook definition of a racist comment”  Trump who hasn t apologized or taken back any of his comments indicated on Friday that he realized his words have had a negative effect on his campaign and declared he is not a racist  “I am the least racist person The least racist person that you ve ever seen I mean give me a break” he said at the rally “I am the least racist person that you ve ever looked at believe me”

satirize and lampoon the founder of Islam was intended to have both a defiant and provocative freespeech edge  Sunday s contest and its $10000 prize were prompted in part by the Paris Charlie Hebdo massacre in January Ms Geller said in March as well as the riots in Muslim countries sparked by the publication of satirical antiMuhammad cartoons by a Danish newspaper in 2005 And indeed as if on cue two gunmen with apparent ties to Islamic militants overseas tried to storm the heavily secured event in a similar fashion before being shot dead by a local police officer Sunday night  The incident comes at a time when tensions between some segments of American society and Muslims appear to be becoming more fraught  with protests against Muslims in Texas and antiMuslim socialmedia attacks after the release of the film American Sniper In that context Gellers actions raise questions about speech seen by many as motivated to incite anger and hatred  It is an issue Geller has faced before Two weeks ago she won a federal freespeech case against New York s Metropolitan Transportation Authority which had refused to put up one of her ads “Killing Jews is Worship that draws us close to Allah”  a quote the ad attributes to “Hamas MTV”  Geller s organization has often clashed with officials in other cities including Philadelphia and Washington over their incendiary ads some of which compare Islam to Nazism In 2012 another federal judge ruled that cities could not refuse to post her subway poster that read “In any war between the civilized man and the savage support the civilized man Support Israel Defeat Jihad”  Many supporters of Geller and her organization view the violence on Sunday as a vindication of their views of Islam as an inherently violenceprone religion But for others her relentless campaign to push the boundaries of free speech with intentionally incendiary messages is only poisoning public discourse at a particularly volatile time  “And coming as it did right when we the United States of America are really facing a time when we have to question what it is that holds us together I can see this potentially aggravating the alreadychallenging times for dealing with some of these questions about cultural difference diversity and what kind of society we want to be” says Gordon Coonfield director of graduate studies in communication at Villanova University near Philadelphia  After analyzing some of the submissions to the American Freedom Defense Initiative s “Muhammad Art Exhibit and Cartoon Contest” Professor Coonfield pointed out the similarities of some of the depictions of the prophet Muhammad to posters for “Der Ewige Jude” or “The Eternal Jew” a notorious Nazi propaganda “documentary”  In one of the cartoons the prophet is depicted as contorted and snarling and as a hooknosed man in a turban holding a bloody knife The caption reads “When it comes to religion  I ve got the edge” The face Coonfield notes is nearly identical to the contorted face of “The Eternal Jew” poster  “That strategy for creating a sense of  unity  by lifting up this internal enemy is as old as human civilization and culture” he says “It s ironic that the kind of thinking that Hitler used and the Nazis have become famous for using  propaganda to try to create this sense of a collective by creating a strong unquestionably evil Other who is right here in our midst  so it s kind of ironic that she s trying to link some of these things together when that is in fact her message”  Despite the fact that images depicting the prophet Muhammad cut deeply to the heart of Muslim identity Muslim leaders in Texas told their followers not to picket or protest the event on Sunday  “Her words are not just free speech” says Linda Sarsour executive director of the Arab American Association of New York “They are inciteful they incite hate against our whole community I was very dismayed by the shooting in Garland Texas but at the same time Pamela Geller is not the victim in this situation that we re in right now”  “She intentionally put that event together in hopes that she d get the response that she received” Ms Sarsour says  “We prayed but not one Muslim from the state of Texas went out to protest her” she added “Muslim leaders specifically told people do not go anywhere near her Let her do whatever she does We don t care And there was no protesting outside  unfortunately except for these two guys from Arizona who were already on the radar of the FBI anyway”  Advocates have tried to counter Geller s free political expressions with ad campaigns of a different tone In 2012 a coalition called Rabbis for Human Rights responded to her “support the civilized man” poster with an opposing message that read “In the choice between love and hate choose love Help stop bigotry against our Muslim neighbors”  And last week the makers of the satirical film “The Muslims Are Coming” launched a humorous series of subway and bus ads to counter Gellers “The Muslims are coming and they shall strike with hugs so fierce you ll end up calling your grandmother and telling her that you love her”  But in an era in which the Islamic State the Tsarnaev trial and the lingering aftermath of 911 still inflame fears about Islam many worry that Sunday s violence will exacerbate the current tensions  “Free speech is about being open to listening to the ideas you hate the most that you disagree with the most and I feel this group in particular is hiding behind this free speech rhetoric” Coonfield says “This can t become the poster child for Christianity versus Islam or the West versus the Middle East We have to maintain a space where groups that have very different ways of thinking and viewing the world can still come together to talk about it without resorting to this kind of craziness”

            "|REAL |FAKE      |While the country has been fixated on Donald Trumps tormenting his Republican primary opponents and deeply concerned about the government s efforts to identify any confederates in the San Bernardino California killings a team of federal prosecutors and FBI agents continues to examine Hillary Clinton s tenure as secretary of state in order to determine whether she committed any crimes and if so whether there is sufficient evidence to prove her guilt beyond a reasonable doubt  What began as an innocent Freedom of Information Act request by Judicial Watch a DCbased public advocacy group promoting transparency in the executive branch has now become a full criminal investigation with Clinton as the likely target  The basic facts are wellknown but the revealed nuances are important as well When the State Department responded to the Judicial Watch FOIA request by telling Judicial Watch that it had no emails from Clinton Judicial Watch filed a lawsuit When the State Department made the same representation to the court  as incredible as it seemed at the time  the judge accepted that representation and the case was dismissed  Then The New York Times revealed that Clinton used a private email server instead of the government s server for all of her workrelated and personal emails during her four years as secretary of state After that the Judicial Watch FOIA case was reinstated and then the judge in the case demanded of State that it produce Clinton s emails  When Judicial Watch expressed frustration to the judge about the pace at which it was getting emails the judge ordered Clinton “under penalty of perjury” to certify that she had surrendered all her governmental emails to the State Department  Eventually Clinton did certify to the court that she did surrender all of her governmental emails to the State Department She did so by sending paper copies of selected emails because she had wiped clean her server She acknowledged that she decided which emails were personal and which were selected as governmental and returned the governmental ones to the State Department She has denied steadfastly and consistently that she ever sent or received any materials marked classified” while secretary of state using her private server  All of her behavior has triggered the FBI investigation because she may have committed serious federal crimes For example it is a crime to steal federal property What did she steal By diverting to her own venue the digital metadata that accompany all emails  metadata that when attached to the workrelated emails of a government employee belong to the government  she stole that data The metadata do not appear on her paper copies  hence the argument that she stole and destroyed the governmentowned metadata  This is particularly troublesome for her present political ambitions because of a federal statute that disqualifies from public office all who have stolen federal property She is probably already barred from public office  though this was not prominently raised when she entered the US Senate or the Department of State  because of the china silverware and furniture that she and her husband took from the White House in January 2001  Clinton may also have committed espionage by failing to secure the government secrets entrusted to her She did that by diverting those secrets to an unprotected nongovernmental venue  her own server  and again by emailing those secrets to other unprotected and nongovernmental venues The reason she can deny sending or receiving anything marked classified” is that protected government secrets are not marked “classified”  So her statement though technically true is highly misleading The governmental designations of protected secrets are “confidential” “secret” and “top secret”  not “classified” State Department investigators have found 999 emails sent or received by Clinton in at least one of those three categories of protected secrets  Back when Clinton became secretary of state on her first day in office she had an hourlong FBI briefing on the proper and lawfully required care of government secrets She signed a statement under penalty of perjury acknowledging that she knew the law and that it is the content of emails not any stamped markings that makes them secret  Earlier this week my Fox News colleagues confirmed the certain presence of topsecret materials among the 999 emails Intelligence from foreign sources or about foreign governments is always topsecret whether designated as such or not And she knows that  As well she may have committed perjury in the FOIA case When the House Select Committee on Benghazi in its investigation of her role in the deaths of the US ambassador to Libya and three other Americans gathered emails it found emails she did not surrender to the State Department  Last week the State Department released emails that give the FBI more areas to investigate These emails may show a pattern of official behavior by Clinton designed to benefit the financial interests of her familys foundation her husband and her soninlaw Moreover the FBI knows of a treasuretrove of documents that may demonstrate that the Clinton Foundation skirted the law and illegally raised and spent contributions  Two months ago a group of FBI agents sat around a conference table and reviewed the evidence gathered thus far Each agent was given the opportunity to make or detract from the case for moving forward At the end of the meeting it was the consensus of the group to pursue a criminal investigation  And Clinton is the likely target  Andrew P Napolitano a former judge of the Superior Court of New Jersey is the senior judicial analyst at Fox News Channel

            "|REAL |FAKE      |GOP opposes the kind of antitrust regulation that would preserve freedom of expression online  America s right wing is in a froth about allegations that Facebook has tweaked its “trending news” feed to reduce the visibility of conservative news sites  It s not clear if the allegations from a Gizmodo report based on anonymous sources are true and Facebook denies them But the deeper problem is undeniably real Facebook is the dominant member of a small number of giant entities   corporate and governmental   that are gaining control over news freedom of expression and much of our digital lives The irony is that the conservatives and businessbacked Republicans in Congress who howl about Facebook are the same people who have thwarted policies that would encourage the competition we need to challenge that increasingly centralized control  Almost no one wants to address the fact that Facebook is becoming a monopoly in the antitrust sense of the word Along with Google it dominates online advertising Facebook especially does so on mobile devices which are the way many people connect to the Internet If you offer news and information online you have almost no choice but to play on Facebook s field because so much of your audience is there In some parts of the world Facebook essentially is the Internet because mobile devices are pretty much the sole means of online access and in some cases the company has made deals with local telecommunications companies and or governments  Facebook has been buying everything that presents even a whiff of competition Instagram WhatsApp Oculus This is smart   no one can dispute that Mark Zuckerberg and the others on his team are brilliant technologists and strategists   but it s also a red flag As Zuckerberg famously said several years ago he wants Facebook to be “like electricity” Well electricity is a utility And we regulate utilities  Monopolies and cozy oligopolies never turn out well in the long run for anyone but the monopolists or cartel members They end up controlling markets and do their best to thwart genuine competition It s their nature Which is why capitalism plainly the best system when it s working right needs rules to promote competition  Yet Republicans in general think the government should play little to no role in promoting competition They consider antitrust inquiry and enforcement to be counterproductive at best   except of course when a powerful constituent a corporation usually is in danger from predatory behavior  That attitude accounts for the GOP s cheerleading for corporate dominance of Internet access Republicans in general are fine with the idea that one or two companies say the leading cable provider and another telecom should control access in most communities and utterly opposed to a remedy   what we call network neutrality   to ensure that people at the edges of networks not dominant Internet service providers should decide what information they want and at what priority  I don t want the government to tell Facebook what it can publish and don t look forward to much more than posturing from Congress But I do want the government to start paying extremely close attention to the way the company is becoming a monopoly and to what it means for freedom of expression when a single company has so much power over what people say online I want government to use antitrust and other procompetition laws to ensure that Facebook doesn t abuse its dominance in a business sense I want governments to promote open technology and communications and fierce competition at every level Kudos to Zuckerberg for making Facebook so appealing to millions of users that s an amazing achievement But we can t allow Facebook to leverage that success to block the emergence of alternatives to its service or use its market power to influence or alter the content of publications and others trying to communicate with Facebook users  We all need to wake up to the potential threat Facebook poses to freedom of expression Once you are in its enclosed online space it is the corporation s terms of service not the First Amendment that determines what you can say If it decides to downplay speech it doesn t like Facebook has the right to do so  So I m glad that conservatives are concerned even if the allegations prove overblown Facebook has modified its outright denial to a “we re looking into it” stance stay tuned I d be even happier if conservatives realized that government does have a role in promoting genuine competition

a suicide bombing at the Brussels Airport on March 22 2016 The attacks on the airport and a subway killed 32 people and wounded more than 300 ISIS claims its fighters launched the attacks in the Belgian capital  My purpose here today is to assert in my judgment ISIS is responsible for genocide against groups in areas under its control including Yazidis Christians and Shiite Muslims he said during a news conference at the State Department  Kerry said that in 2014 ISIS trapped Yazidis killed them enslaved thousands of Yazidi women and girls  selling them at auction raping them at will and destroying the communities in which they had lived for countless generations executed Christians solely for their faith and also forced Christian women and girls into slavery  Without our intervention it is clear that those people would have been slaughtered he said  This is the first time that the United States has declared a genocide since Darfur in 2004  The House of Representatives on Monday unanimously passed a resolution labeling the ISIS atrocities against Christian groups in Syria and Iraq genocide a term the State Department had been reluctant to use about the attacks and mass murders by the terror group  The move aimed at ramping up pressure on the Obama administration appears to have worked  The measure was nonbinding but both Republicans and Democrats in the House joined together 3930 to back a sense of Congress saying the crimes committed against Christians Yazidis and other ethnic and religious minorities in the region amount to war crimes and in some cases genocide  Republican Rep Jeff Fortenberry whose Nebraska district is home to the largest group of resettled Yazidis in the US authored the resolution with California Democratic Rep Anna Eshoo  During debate on Monday Fortenberry noted it was a rare instance of an issue that has risen above the petty and difficult differences we often work out on the floor of the House of Representatives  Under a deadline set by Congress the State Department had until Thursday to formally to decide whether it would issue a comprehensive genocide designation  Kerry though had previously alluded to the possibility that the actions of ISIS also know as ISIL were genocide  ISILs campaign of terror against the innocent including the Yazidi and Christian minorities and its grotesque targeted acts of violence show all the warning signs of genocide Kerry said in August 2014 For anyone who needed a wakeup call this is it  Fortenberry praised the State Department for its decision Thursday  I commend Secretary Kerry and the State Department for making this important designation The genocide against Christians Yazidis and others is not only a grave injustice to theses ancient faith communities  it is an assault on human dignity and an attack on civilization itself he said The United States has now spoken with clarity and moral authority  That it took so long for the administration to arrive at this conclusion in the face of unspeakable human suffering defies explanation Rubio who until Tuesday was a GOP presidential candidate said in a statement At long last the United States is no longer silent in the face of this evil but it would be travesty if we were to mistakenly take solace in this designation if the designation did not then yield some sort of action  I am very happy to hear that the US will recognize the genocide of Yezidi and Christian minorities he told CNN in an email This is an important step to stop the suffering of the persecuted people under the control of the extremist islamic groups specially ISIS And this is also important for my community to trust the international community again because we were left in the hands of Islamic State  He called on the State Department to push the UN to establish an international criminal court case on genocide against the Yazidis and Christians in Iraq and Syria  Furthermore he said it is necessary to give the minorities more support to be sure that these crimes will not happen again  An international center advocating against hate terrorism and antiSemitism was one to join the chorus  The Simon Wiesenthal Center applauds Secretary Kerrys acknowledgement that Christians and Yazidis are targets of Genocide the organization said in a statement We reiterate our call that the US put these two groups at the front of the line for consideration for immigration to our country and to redouble our efforts to destroy ISIS  In Defense of Christians a group that has heavily lobbied for recognizing what is happening as genocide put out a statement from its president Toufic Baaklini  IDC extends our deepest gratitude to Secretary Kerry and to the Obama administration for carefully reviewing the overwhelming evidence of the genocide against Christians Yazidis Shia Muslims and other religious minorities and for proclaiming the irrefutable truth that the crimes they have suffered constitute genocide Baaklini said  And the Archbishop of Washington Cardinal Donald Wuerl put out a statement of appreciation  For some time the world has witnessed the deliberate and organized effort by ISIS to eliminate Christians from the Middle East For the US government to call this savagery by its proper name  genocide  is a welcome step in what must now be a more committed effort at bringing peace and security to that beleaguered land Wuerl said These words must now be translated into action|\n",

earlymorning “ambushstyle” killing of two police officers in the Des Moines metro area  The suspect in the backtoback killings was identified as Scott Michael Greene said Urbandale police spokesman Sgt Chad Underwood Before capturing him police had described Greene who was last seen driving a blue Ford F150 with an Iowa license plate as armed and dangerous  Greene was taken into custody by the Dallas County Sheriff s Department while walking along a rural road in Redfield about 35 miles west of where the shootings occurred  According to police Greene flagged down a passing Department of Natural Resources officer handed over his ID and told the officer to call police No shots were fired and there was no struggle according to police  The suspect was taken by ambulance to a Des Moines hospital with an unknown injury  In a late morning news conference police identified the slain officers as Urbandale Police Officer Justin Martin and Des Moines police Sgt Anthony “Tony” Beminio  The attacks began around 106 am CT when police departments from both cities responded to reports of gunfire at the intersection of 70th Street and Aurora Avenue in Urbandale  The first officers arriving on the scene found Martin fatally wounded About 20 minutes later some two miles away Beminio was was shot near the intersection of Merle Hay Road and Sheridan Ave while responding to reports of the first officer s shooting Beminio was transported to Iowa Methodist Medical Center where he died Scott Michael Greene Photo Des Moines Police  Both officers were gunned down in their patrol cars  “It doesn t look like there was any interaction between these officers and whoever the coward is that shot them while they sat in their cars” a visibly emotional Parizek told reporters  “In all appearances it looks … that these officers were ambushed” he added Officer from Des Moines and another from Urbandale were shot and killed in their cars dmpolice said officersdown    Daniel P Finney newsmanone November 2 2016  Des Moines police fearing officers were being singled out paired up its patrol officers so none were on the street alone Parizek said  “There s literally a clear and present danger if you re a police officer” he said  Police did not offer many details on how investigators identified Greene as a suspect Underwood said he was identified “through a series of leads and a series of investigative tips”  As of an earlymorning news conference police were still notifying the family members of the slain officers and planned to withhold the officers  names years of service and other details until later in the day Parizek said  Attorney General Loretta Lynch condemned the killings saying “violence has no place in the United States of America    “Let me be clear there is no message in murder   the attorney general said referring to simmering distrust between law enforcement and many communities across the country “Violence creates nothing it only destroys   A Des Moines police officer was found fatally shot in a vehicle near the intersection of Merle Hay Road and Sheridan Avenue in Des Moines on Wednesday Nov 2 2016 Photo Brian Powers The Des Moines Register  It s the first time Des Moines has seen a police officer shot and killed in the line of duty since two officers were gunned down in separate incidents in 1977  Two Des Moines officers Susan Farrell and Carlos PuenteMorales died earlier this year when their vehicle was struck headon by a wrongway drunk driver  The killing of the Urbandale officer appeared to be the city s first for an officer shot in the line of duty Underwood said at the news conference  Parizek thanked the community for its support when the department lost Farrell and PuenteMorales as well as with this tragedy  “I don t even know where to begin on how bad this year is” he said But “this is what we do We come in day in and day out we go out there and provide the same level of service regardless of what s going on in our personal and professional lives” Officers investigate the scene at Merle Hay and Sheridan ave where an officer was found shot at about 126 AM on on Wednesday Nov 2 2016 in Urbandale  In a statement Iowa Gov Terry Branstad called the attack on the officers “an attack on the public safety of all Iowans”  “We call on Iowans to support our law enforcement officials in bringing this suspect to justice” he said “Our thoughts and prayers go out to the families of the police officers who were tragically killed in the line of duty as well as the officers who continue to put themselves in harm s way”  Iowa Sen Joni Ernst extended her thoughts and prayers to the families of the officers killed  “Although the investigation is still unfolding what appears to be an ambush

            "|FAKE |REAL      |Sharpton Attacks O Keefe So O Keefe Releases Brutal Expose on Sharpton… BOOM  If you are going to wallow in the liberal media mire though MSNBC is by far my favorite   and trust me a yearandahalf of observing presidential campaigns has made me quite a connoisseur of the leftslanting morass  MSNBC pretends that conservatives and Trump supporters are from another planet   or at the very least another culture a sort of cargo cult that is to be studied anthropologically but never taken with any seriousness  This interaction with MSNBC reporter Jacob Rascon on Wednesday proved what I m talking about perfectly He had found a mother and daughter in line apparently for early voting They were also AfricanAmerican which made them a cargo cult on top of a cargo cult by liberal media standards    However when he asked them about criticism of Trump s AfricanAmerican outreach the mother and daughter blew him out of the water  “Well I think Trump is reaching out to all citizens including AfricanAmericans” Trina the daughter told MSNBC “He s trying to address a problem It should not be a problem if you address there is something wrong and you have a plan that wants to help people”  “That s what a president should do for us He should reach out and try to help people and address problems that s going on in our country”  “Some of the criticisms have been about Trump s pitch to minority voters  What do you have to lose ” Rascon said to Gloria the mother “What do you think about that criticism”

            "|REAL |FAKE      |A strong majority of Democratic voters think Hillary Clinton should keep running for president even if she is charged with a felony in connection with her private email use while secretary of state according to a new poll  Clinton was strongly criticized in a State Department inspector general report last week about her email use  The report found repeated warnings about cybersecurity were ignored and staffers who expressed concerns were told “never to speak of the Secretary s personal email system again”  Yet this seems not to be a big issue among Democrats The Rasmussen poll released Tuesday found 71 percent of Democratic voters believe she should keep running even if indicted a view shared by only 30 percent of Republicans and 46 percent of unaffiliated voters Overall 50 percent of those polled said she should keep running  The FBI investigation into her email practices is still ongoing Democratic primary rival Bernie Sanders has avoided commenting specifically on that probe but campaign manager Jeff Weaver on Wednesday questioned whether she could keep going if an indictment comes down  That would be difficult to continue running a race Weaver told Fox News on Wednesday when asked about the poll  The email scandal could still be problematic for Clintons general election hopes with 40 percent of all voters saying they are less likely to vote for Clinton because of it  though 48 percent of voters said it would have no impact on their vote  The Democratic primary frontrunner s argument that she did nothing illegal with her email use is also apparently failing to sway many voters According to the poll 65 percent of voters consider it likely that Clinton broke the law with her email use with 47 percent saying it s very likely  The poll of 1000 likely voters was conducted May 2930 It had a margin of error of 3 percentage points

            "|REAL |FAKE      |It s impossible to overstate how colossal a fuckup this is At every level across both parties the media pollsters   all the democratic institutions that are supposed to prevent something like this from happening or at least warn us about it Donald Trump a Republican candidate who ran an openly racist campaign who is as proud a misogynist as you ll find anywhere who is manifestly ignorant of public policy who is brusquely authoritarian who has little respect or understanding of democratic norms and who embodies every moral failing that s supposed to disqualify a candidate from higher office has apparently been elected as the next president of the United States  The markets are collapsing the globe is reeling and nobody can quite explain what the hell happened But here s what this failure will mean The climate which is warming precipitously is now guaranteed to continue along that trajectory toward global catastrophe The millions of people who gained health coverage over the last half of a decade are now at acute risk of being thrown off their insurance plan and left to the unfeeling mercies of insurance underwriters  Income inequality already at dangerously high levels will only grow worse as tax cuts for the rich and spending cuts for the poor are pushed through the Republican Congress Unprecedented GOP obstructionism on Supreme Court nominees has been rewarded in the worst possible way And the foreign policy of the United States will be run by a bona fide ignoramus  The man elected to the most powerful office in the land has no idea what to do with it and no concept of its limitations He attracts the worst people to him sycophants and powerhungry strivers who will be placed in positions of authority and who will obey the boss  diktat above anything else Every democratic norm he gleefully shredded along the way is gone for good Every thumb in the eye of transparency will now be official policy  But right now those things are not what I think about when I contemplate life under President Donald Trump This will sound trite but primarily I think about my two boys a 2yearold and a 4monthold I don t have to explain this to them because neither would understand But if I were to tell my 2yearold what is happening I d do it in Spanish because both he and his brother have deep Mexican roots that my wife and I want them to embrace and be proud of It destroys me to know that they that we live in a country that seems to have chosen as its leader a person who made frenzied racial attacks on my family s heritage the launch pad for his successful presidential run I think about the AfricanAmericans Muslims Jews and Latinos in this country who now face life in a country presided over by a candidate who embodies white nationalism and memorably couldn t bring himself to disavow a former leader of the Ku Klux Klan Children of undocumented immigrants who are US citizens by birth have been told by their new president that they ll be deported Refugees from Syria who were relocated here to escape war and violence will have another target on their backs These are the people who will feel the consequences of this failure most acutely I have one more thing to add I am sorry In my capacity as a media figure I too often treated Trump as a joke a bumbling incompetent someone who obviously could not be treated seriously as a legitimate candidate for the presidency Now I can only think that I was too hidebound by conventional wisdom too comfortably out of touch to see what was in front of me I succumbed to the sideshow element of this awful race more times than I can be comfortable with I own this failure too

            "|FAKE |REAL      |Before Its News It is fun to look at polls and using such data decide which candidate will win which state and ultimately which candidate will win the electoral college A lot of people and organizations do that and for this reason I don t I do not have access to polls that no one else sees Were I to use polling data to directly predict outcomes per state I d use a method like that used by FiveThirtyEight and probably come up with similar results How boring It would be a waste of my time to try to replicate the excellent work done by Nate Silver and his team Back during the Democratic Primaries I decided that I wanted to get a handle on which candidate was likely to win fairly early on The polling based estimates were inadequate because most states simply didn t have polling data that early in the process So I invented an alternative method which made certain estimates of how voters with different ethnic identities would vote That method accurately predicted several primary outcomes outperforming the poll based methods such as those used by FiveThirtyEight After a while enough primaries had been carried out that I could switch methods slightly Using the same exact model but primed with the results of prior primaries that year rather than my estimates of voter behavior I used the ethnic distribution data for each state to predict the outcome of upcoming primary contests Once again my method was very accurate and once again it out performed the polling based methods So recently I ve tried to apply a similar method to estimating the electoral outcome for this year s presidential race But it is impossible to use the same exact method because the entire thing happens all on one day I can t use the election results from a handful of states to estimate the likely future outcomes in other states I recognize that polling data is very limited on a national level Things happen during an election season that probably change people s likely voting behavior especially among independents Solid states are rarely polled and small states swing or not are rarely polled Many polls are of low quality Right now for instance fewer than half of the states have polls that were a taken fully after the final POTUS debate and b have an A or better rating from FiveThirtyEight If I allow the use of B and occasional C ratings for recent polls and allow a few polls to include periods of time prior to the last POTUS debate but only in states that are very strongly in favor of one candidate or the other and thus likely to not move anyway I can find 32 states that have sort of usable polling data Interestingly states with some of the more controversial changes happening like Utah and Iowa are not adequately polled In order to apply a model like the one I used in the Primaries to the current election I used the 32 states for which there was somewhat acceptable recent polling data to inform the model to calculate the regression coefficients in order to then separately predict the likely voting behavior Trump vs Clinton in all of the states Before I show you the map however I need to discuss something else About a week ago the press especially the somewhat more left leaning press and various commenters seeing much reaction to a series of events beginning with the NYT release of Trump s tax return and ending with the final POTUS debate events which sandwiched the sexual assault tapes and accusations collectively decided that a huge gap between Clinton and Trump was rapidly opening up and the race would end with a double digit spread an electoral rout and a big party Soon after I pointed out that this may not be correct That polling data seemed to show rather that there was an expansion of the difference between the two candidates followed by a reclosing of the gap with Clinton still leading but by about as much as before this temporary shift To this I added a concern If too many people assumed that the race was over and in the double digit range perhaps there could be a GOTV backlash effect or a funding effect that would shift things to within shooting distance for Trump I was not alone in thinking this and I was probably right The GOP sunk via pacs 25 million dollars into Senate races in response to the Democrats shifting from the national race to the Senate which was followed by the Democrats shifting back to the national race in certain states presumably recognizing that the polls were artificially spread Indeed some who criticized arguing mainly from incredulity and good wishes my admonition noted correctly that some of that narrowing was because a bunch of rightleaning polls had come out all at once This is true but it ignores that a bunch of leftleaning polls had made the formation of the Great Gap of GOP Defeat look a lot bigger than it ever really was I say all this as part one of my preparation for what I m going to tell you below which is not the news you want to hear Part two is some logic I d like to bludgeon you with Consider these points 1 True Trump supporters could give a rat s ass about sexual assault poor debate performance or tax forms Donald Trump was correct when he said weeks ago now forgotten that he could gun someone down on the streets of Manhattan and he would not lose support form his base These people did not abandon him when he was heard to talk about sexual assault If anything they were energized by it And I m talking about something just shy of 40 of the voters We live in a barely civilized asshole country 2 Please tell me exactly which Hillary Clinton supporters who were going to vote for Clinton over Trump all along are NOW going to pick Clinton if polled or on voting day that change from not being Clinton supporters to being Clinton supporters In other words this is a somewhat subtle point which people who hated Trump became True Haters of Trump after the sexual assault thing Almost none They were already there 3 The third category of people the undecideds who are only lying about being undecided in most cases and the socalled “reasonable Republicans” of which there are very very few who could conceivably shift from Trump to Clinton are going to divide their voting activities between Johnson a write in as they are being advised by Republican leaders in some cases or simply staying home In other words over the last few weeks no source has emerged that hands Secretary Clinton more electoral votes than she probably had about a month ago and Trump is not going to have any or at least not many electoral votes go away Those observations part one and that logic part two cause me to be utterly unsurprised to find out that an analysis of the electoral map I did on October 16th and one I did today do not show Clinton pulling farther ahead In fact the two analyses have Clinton being less far ahead than Trump now than ten days ago The difference is in Ohio shifting from Clinton to Trump which is almost certainly going to happen and North Carolina which shifted from Clinton to Trump in this analysis which seems much less likely to happen and Arizona shifting from Clinton that was probably wishful thinking to Trump The point here is this plain and simple An analysis using a technique that has worked very well for me in the past shows that the difference between that moment of Maximal Clintonosity and today is plus or minus a couple of state In other words not different Maybe a little worse Really about the same Here s the current map Obviously I will be watching for more data over the next few days I assume there will be a spate of polls as we approach November 8th the day Democrats vote Republicans vote on the 28th of November If so then there will be convergence between my method of calibration and my method of calculation and the model will consume itself by the tail and become very accurate at the same time But between now and then perhaps that very small number of polls that are both recent and high quality will grow a bit more and I can do this again and resolve those closer states By the way the “swing states” according to my model the states where things are close are Ohio North Carolina Arizona and Georgia of those now in the Trump column Those are indeed swing states Numerically the close states that are in the Clinton column are Virginia New Hampshire and Pennsylvania

            "|FAKE |REAL      |WATCH CNN Hack Humiliates Self Tells Viewers US Reps Are TermLimited Already They re Not  That breakdown in communication in Washington is exactly what has fueled the rise of Trump  People are sick and tired of nothing getting done at least nothing good so they want a new leader who can actually accomplish great things  “I think that we have decided that rather than confront the disagreement and differences of opinion we ll just simply annihilate the person who disagrees with us” Thomas said  Unfortunately he is exactly right Both Republicans and Democrats are guilty of preferring to demonize their opponents rather than engaging in meaningful discussion    This sort of polarization doesn t help America All it does is increase the frustration the American people have with Congress when they see nothing happening for years  Trump has a history of making compromises and hammering out complex deals in the business world Unlike Democrat nominee

            "|REAL |FAKE      |On September 5 2006 Eli Chomsky was an editor and staff writer for the Jewish Press and Hillary Clinton was running for a shooin reelection as a US senator Her trip making the rounds of editorial boards brought her to Brooklyn to meet the editorial board of the Jewish Press  The tape was never released and has only been heard by the small handful of Jewish Press staffers in the room According to Chomsky his oldschool audiocassette is the only existent copy and no one has heard it since 2006 until today when he played it for the Observer  The tape is 45 minutes and contains much that is no longer relevant such as analysis of the reelection battle that Sen Joe Lieberman was then facing in Connecticut But a seemingly throwaway remark about elections in areas controlled by the Palestinian Authority has taken on new relevance amid persistent accusations in the presidential campaign by Clinton s Republican opponent Donald Trump that the current election is “rigged”  Speaking to the Jewish Press about the January 25 2006 election for the second Palestinian Legislative Council the legislature of the Palestinian National Authority Clinton weighed in about the result which was a resounding victory for Hamas 74 seats over the USpreferred Fatah 45 seats  “I do not think we should have pushed for an election in the Palestinian territories I think that was a big mistake” said Sen Clinton “And if we were going to push for an election then we should have made sure that we did something to determine who was going to win”  Chomsky recalls being taken aback that “anyone could support the idea offered by a national political leader no less that the US should be in the business of fixing foreign elections”  Some eyebrows were also raised when thenSenator Clinton appeared to make a questionable moral equivalency  Regarding capturing combatants in war the June capture of IDF soldier Gilad Shalit by Hamas militants who came across the Gaza border via an underground tunnel was very much front of mind Clinton can be heard on the tape saying “And then when you know Hamas you know sent the terrorists you know through the tunnel into Israel that killed and captured you know kidnapped the young Israeli soldier you know there s a sense of like oneupsmanship and in these cultures of you know well if they captured a soldier we ve got to capture a soldier”  Equating Hamas which to this day remains on the State Department s official list of Foreign Terrorist Organizations with the armed forces of a close American ally was not what many expected to hear in the Jewish Press editorial offices which were then at Third Avenue and Third Street in Brooklyn The paper s office has since moved to the Boro Park section of Brooklyn The use of the phrase “these cultures” is also a bit of a headscratcher  According to Chomsky Clinton was “gracious personable and pleasant throughout” the interview taking about an hour to speak to in addition to himself managing editor Jerry Greenwald assistant to the publisher Naomi Klass Mauer counsel Dennis Rapps and senior editor Jason Maoz  Another part of the tape highlights something that was relatively uncontroversial at the time but has taken on new meaning in light of the current campaign speaking to leaders with whom our country is not on the best terms Clinton has presented a very tough front in discussing Russia for example accusing Trump of unseemly ardor for strongman Vladimir Putin and mocking his oftstated prediction that as president he d “get along” with Putin  Chomsky is heard on the tape asking Clinton what now seems like a prescient question about Syria given the disaster unfolding there and its looming threat to drag the US Iran and Russia into confrontation  “Do you think it s worth talking to Syria both from the US point of view and Israel s point of view”  Clinton replied “You know I m pretty much of the mind that I don t see what it hurts to talk to people As long as you re not stupid and giving things away I mean we talked to the Soviet Union for 40 years They invaded Hungary they invaded Czechoslovakia they persecuted the Jews they invaded Afghanistan they destabilized governments they put missiles 90 miles from our shores we never stopped talking to them” an answer that reflects her mastery of the facts but also reflects a willingness to talk to Russia that sounds more like Trump 2016 than Clinton 2016  Shortly after she said “But if you say  they re evil we re good and we re never dealing with them  I think you give up a lot of the tools that you need to have in order to defeat them…So I would like to talk to you the enemy because I want to know more about you Because if I want to defeat you I ve got to know something more about you I need different tools to use in my campaign against you That s my take on it”  A final bit of interest to the current campaign involves an articulation of phrases that Trump has accused Clinton of being reluctant to use Discussing the need for a response to terrorism Clinton said “I think you can make the case that whether you call it  Islamic terrorism  or  Islamofascism  whatever the label is we re going to give to this phenomenon it s a threat It s a global threat To Europe to Israel to the United States…Therefore we need a global response It s a global threat and it needs a global response That can be the sort of statement of principle…So I think sometimes having the global vision is a help as long as you realize that underneath that global vision there s a lot of variety and differentiation that has to go on”  It s not clear what she means by a global vision with variety and differentiation but what s quite clear is that the thensenator just five years after her state was the epicenter of the September 11 attacks was comfortable deploying the phrase “Islamic terrorism” and the even more strident “Islamofascism” at least when meeting with the editorial board of a Jewish newspaper  In an interview before the Observer heard the tape Chomsky told the Observer that Clinton made some “odd and controversial comments” on the tape The irony of a decadeold recording emerging to feature a candidate making comments that are suddenly relevant to voters today was not lost on Chomsky who wrote the original story at the time Oddly enough that story headlined “Hillary Clinton on Israel Iraq and Terror” is no longer available on jewishpresscom and even a short summary published on the Free Republic site offers a broken link that can no longer surface the story  “I went to my bosses at the time” Chomsky told the Observer “The Jewish Press had this mindset that they would not want to say anything offensive about anybody even a direct quote from anyone in a position of influence because they might need them down the road My bosses didn t think it was newsworthy at the time I was convinced that it was and I held onto it all these years”  Disclosure

            "|REAL |FAKE      |The United States comes up constantly when you talk to Russians about their countrys place in the world But the conversations tend to go a lot differently than many Americans might expect  In the US the common view is that Russians feel aggrieved by the loss of the Soviet Union and all the respect that came with being a global superpower Russias acts of aggression in Europe in this telling are all about challenging the Americanled order as a way to prove Russias might and importance This aggression is wildly popular among Russians many Americans believe because it makes them feel patriotic and powerful to bully the West and particularly the US which they blame for Russias problems  Russia took off its ideological blinders in 1991 but America still seems to have them on  There is certainly truth to this but its just a piece of the truth Rather when you speak to influential people across institutions and the political spectrum in Russia as Amanda Taub and I did during a recent reporting trip there the story you hear over and over is one of Russias fundamental weakness And you hear a preoccupation with the United States that goes far beyond what even many Americans who are famously narcissistic about our country would expect  In this telling Moscow capitulated at the end of the Cold War and even tried to make itself a friend to the far more powerful United States But an irrationally aggressive America has instead sought repeatedly to weaken control or even destroy Russia Their country in this view is insecure against an overwhelmingly powerful West Its actions that we see as aggressive are actually defensive And Moscow is kept safe only by careful vigilance and by the nuclear arsenal that you hear Russians cite over and over  This is the version of history you hear in Russia from detached foreign policy pragmatists from proPutin ideologues and antiPutin ideologues even from members of the proWestern political opposition who support what they believe be to a Western agenda of weakening Russia  Theres a quote that speaks perfectly to this Russian worldview   and how Americans misunderstand it   in the most recent issue of Russia in Global Affairs a Russian foreign policy journal that is widely considered to reflect the views of Russias foreign policy establishment The quote is from a QA with Vladimir Lukin a prominent Russian diplomat and liberal politician who previously served as ambassador to the US  Interviewer In his 1994 book Diplomacy Henry Kissinger writes that integrating Russia into the international system is a key task for the United States But as he was saying this the Americans were actually pushing Moscow away with their policy Why Vladimir Lukin It is in the genes America has a simple ideology  that there is only one truth in the world that truth is held by God and God created the United States to be an embodiment of that truth So the Americans strive to bring this truth to the rest of the world and to make it happy Only after that will everything be well This ideology has a strong influence on their policy A wise traditionalist and a geopolitical expert Kissinger had good reason to call such politicians Trotskyites for advocating a world revolution albeit in their own way but always in the front and in shining armor This is a tempting ideology and has been professed by different countries at different times not only the United States  Lukin is hardly seen as an antiAmerican hardliner in Russia   rather hes considered to be an objective expert on the United States and a highly professional diplomat He is a founding member of the liberal opposition party Yabloko That he would get the United States so obviously wrong   what Americans would call defending democracy and human rights he sees as a far more radical and explicitly religious agenda of advocating a world revolution   is troubling But his view is a common one and that tells you a great deal  The interviewers response is similarly telling So Russia took off its ideological blinders in 1991 but America still seems to have them on The Soviet Union is gone but the policy against it is not  This narrative of an inherently aggressive America is one we heard over and over in Moscow not just from people who support Russian President Vladimir Putin and his aggressive antiAmerican policies but even from those who oppose them In this view American politics and policies are bent on and in many ways driven by a hatred of Russia and desire to destroy or at least control it Russia has had no choice but to meet American aggression with defensive actions such as putting nuclearcapable missiles in Europe or arming eastern Ukrainian militias at threat of genocidal extermination by Americanbacked fascists if only to deter the US from further actions that could lead to allout war  Its not hard to poke holes in this Russian worldview As Stephen Sestanovich a longtime senior State Department official who helped engineer the Clinton administrations Russia policies wrote in a recent article for the American Interest even the pragmatic Russian case for annexing Crimea in March 2014 makes little strategic sense  Yet this was the worldview we heard even from professionals and politicians in Russia who oppose antiWestern policies One foreign policy expert who wished for rapprochement with the West sighed to us that it would be impossible because Hillary Clinton whom he said was widely viewed as irrationally antiRussian would soon take office At another meeting a political opposition leader remarked offhand that he hoped the US would be successful in its efforts to engineer regime change in Moscow  As Sestanovich writes in his essay The idea that the United States aims at a color revolution in Moscow is the single most frequently repeated theme of official Russian rhetoric This is more than paranoia or government propaganda it is the accepted worldview that Russia is under constant threat from a hostile and irrational United States  Lukin at another point in his QA lamented that the US had rejected Moscows gestures at cooperation in the 1990s and instead sought to surround Russia with a hostile NATO alliance thus forcing Russia into a defensive crouch and creating todays tensions It was the biggest mistake the West made he said and gradually led to the current situation  These fears about America are likely to worsen in Russia if Hillary Clinton becomes president many people told us she is seen by many Russians especially Russian policymakers as unbendingly hostile to Moscow and bent on the Putin governments destruction  Hillary is the worst option of any president Fyodor Lukyanov an influential Russian foreign policy expert who edits a leading foreign affairs journal and heads a foreign policy think tank told us  Many people here believe that she and her team will try to come back to the line of the 1990s to encourage Russia into an internal transformation Lukyanov added Not by force of course but to encourage some kind of social development that will upend the current system and will promote a new one  WATCH What
